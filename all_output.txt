{"Entity": "Currency", "Content": "\nA currency[a] is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins.[1][2] A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state.[3] Under this definition, the British Pound sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.[4] Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance; i.e., legal tender laws may require a particular unit of account for payments to government agencies.\nOther definitions of the term currency appear in the respective synonymous articles: banknote, coin, and money. This article uses the definition which focuses on the currency systems of countries.\nOne can classify currencies into three monetary systems: fiat money, commodity money, and representative money, depending on what guarantees a currency's value (the economy at large vs. the government's precious metal reserves). Some currencies function as legal tender in certain jurisdictions, or for specific purposes, such as payment to a government (taxes), or government agencies (fees, fines). Others simply get traded for their economic value.\nThe concept of a digital currency has arisen in recent years. Whether government-backed digital notes and coins (such as the digital renminbi in China, for example) will be successfully developed and implemented remains unknown.[5] Digital currencies that are not issued by a government monetary authority, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are different because their value is market-dependent and has no safety net. Various countries have expressed concern about the opportunities that cryptocurrencies create for illegal activities such as scams, ransomware (extortion), money laundering and terrorism.[6] In 2014, the United States IRS advised that virtual currency is treated as property for federal income-tax purposes, and it provides examples of how long-standing tax principles applicable to transactions involving property apply to virtual currency.[7]\nOriginally, currency was a form of receipt, representing grain stored in temple granaries in Sumer in ancient Mesopotamia and in Ancient Egypt.\nIn this first stage of currency, metals were used as symbols to represent value stored in the form of commodities. This formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years. However, the collapse of the Near Eastern trading system pointed to a flaw: in an era where there was no place that was safe to store value, the value of a circulating medium could only be as sound as the forces that defended that store. A trade could only reach as far as the credibility of that military. By the late Bronze Age, however, a series of treaties had established safe passage for merchants around the Eastern Mediterranean, spreading from Minoan Crete and Mycenae in the northwest to Elam and Bahrain in the southeast. It is not known what was used as a currency for these exchanges, but it is thought that oxhide-shaped ingots of copper, produced in Cyprus, may have functioned as a currency.\nIt is thought that the increase in piracy and raiding associated with the Bronze Age collapse, possibly produced by the Peoples of the Sea, brought the trading system of oxhide ingots to an end. It was only the recovery of Phoenician trade in the 10th and 9th centuries BC that led to a return to prosperity, and the appearance of real coinage, possibly first in Anatolia with Croesus of Lydia and subsequently with the Greeks and Persians. In Africa, many forms of value store have been used, including beads, ingots, ivory, various forms of weapons, livestock, the manilla currency, shell money, and ochre and other earth oxides. The manilla rings of West Africa were one of the currencies used from the 15th century onwards to sell slaves. African currency is still notable for its variety, and in many places, various forms of barter still apply.\nThe prevalence of metal coins possibly led to the metal itself being the store of value: first copper, then both silver and gold, and at one point also bronze. Today other non-precious metals are used for coins. Metals were mined, weighed, and stamped into coins. This was to assure the individual accepting the coin that he was getting a certain known weight of precious metal. Coins could be counterfeited, but the existence of standard coins also created a new unit of account, which helped lead to banking. Archimedes' principle provided the next link: coins could now be easily tested for their fine weight of the metal, and thus the value of a coin could be determined, even if it had been shaved, debased or otherwise tampered with (see Numismatics).\nMost major economies using coinage had several tiers of coins of different values, made of copper, silver, and gold. Gold coins were the most valuable and were used for large purchases, payment of the military, and backing of state activities. Units of account were often defined as the value of a particular type of gold coin. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and sometimes also defined a unit of account, while coins of copper or silver, or some mixture of them (see debasement), might be used for everyday transactions. This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. The exact ratios between the values of the three metals varied greatly between different eras and places; for example, the opening of silver mines in the Harz mountains of central Europe made silver relatively less valuable, as did the flood of New World silver after the Spanish conquests. However, the rarity of gold consistently made it more valuable than silver, and likewise silver was consistently worth more than copper.\nIn premodern China, the need for lending and for a medium of exchange that was less physically cumbersome than large numbers of copper coins led to the introduction of paper money, i.e. banknotes. Their introduction was a gradual process that lasted from the late Tang dynasty (618–907) into the Song dynasty (960–1279). It began as a means for merchants to exchange heavy coinage for receipts of deposit issued as promissory notes by wholesalers' shops. These notes were valid for temporary use in a small regional territory. In the 10th century, the Song dynasty government began to circulate these notes amongst the traders in its monopolized salt industry. The Song government granted several shops the right to issue banknotes, and in the early 12th century the government finally took over these shops to produce state-issued currency. Yet the banknotes issued were still only locally and temporarily valid: it was not until the mid 13th century that a standard and uniform government issue of paper money became an acceptable nationwide currency. The already widespread methods of woodblock printing and then Bi Sheng's movable type printing by the 11th century were the impetus for the mass production of paper money in premodern China.\nAt around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit,[8] cheques, promissory notes,[9] savings accounts, transaction accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt,[10] and banking institutions for loans and deposits.[10]\nIn Europe, paper currency was first introduced on a regular basis in Sweden in 1661 (although Washington Irving records an earlier emergency use of it, by the Spanish in a siege during the Conquest of Granada). As Sweden was rich in copper, many copper coins were in circulation, but its relatively low value necessitated extraordinarily big coins, often weighing several kilograms.\nThe advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced the need to transport gold and silver, which was risky; it facilitated loans of gold or silver at interest, since the underlying specie (money in the form of gold or silver coins rather than notes) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed a division of currency into credit- and specie-backed forms. It enabled the sale of investment in joint-stock companies and the redemption of those shares in a paper.\nBut there were also disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, there was nothing to stop issuing authorities from printing more notes than they had specie to back them with. Second, because this increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. Thus paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.\nAt that time, both silver and gold were considered a legal tender and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the instability in the exchange rate between the two grew over the course of the 19th century, with the increases both in the supply of these metals, particularly silver, and in trade. The parallel use of both metals is called bimetallism, and the attempt to create a bimetallic standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States greenback, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.\nBy 1900, most of the industrializing nations were on some form of gold standard, with paper notes and silver coins constituting the circulating medium. Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's law: keeping the gold and silver they received but paying out in notes. This did not happen all around the world at the same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning in the early 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971, an action which was known as the Nixon shock. No country has an enforceable gold standard or silver standard currency system.\nA banknote or a bill is a type of currency and it is commonly used as legal tender in many jurisdictions. Together with coins, banknotes make up the cash form of a currency. Banknotes were initially mostly paper, but Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation developed a polymer currency in the 1980s; it went into circulation on the nation's bicentenary in 1988.[11] Polymer banknotes had already been introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983. As of 2016,[update] polymer currency is used in over 20 countries (over 40 if counting commemorative issues),[12] and dramatically increases the life span of banknotes and reduces counterfeiting.\nThe currency used is based on the concept of lex monetae; that a sovereign state decides which currency it shall use. (See Fiat currency.)\nIn 1978 the International Organization for Standardization published a system of three-digit alphabetic codes (ISO 4217) to denote currencies. These codes are based on two initial letters allocated to a specific country and a final letter denoting a specific monetary unit of account.[13]\nMany currencies use a currency symbol. These are not subject to international standards and are not unique: the dollar sign in particular has many uses.\nDistinct from centrally controlled government-issued currencies, private decentralized trust-reduced networks support alternative currencies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum's ether, which are classified as cryptocurrency since transference transactions are assured through cryptographic signatures validated by all users. With few exceptions, these currencies are not asset backed. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has declared Bitcoin (and, by extension, similar products) to be a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act.[14]\nThere are also branded currencies, for example 'obligation' based stores of value, such as quasi-regulated BarterCard, Loyalty Points (Credit Cards, Airlines) or Game-Credits (MMO games) that are based on reputation of commercial products.[15]\nHistorically, pseudo-currencies have also included company scrip, a form of wages that could only be exchanged in company stores owned by the employers. Modern token money, such as the tokens operated by local exchange trading systems (LETS), is a form of barter rather than being a true currency.\nThe currency may be Internet-based and digital, for instance, Bitcoin[16] is not tied to any specific country, or the IMF's SDR that is based on a basket of currencies (and assets held).\nPossession and sale of alternative forms of currencies is often outlawed by governments in order to preserve the legitimacy of the constitutional currency for the benefit of all citizens. For example, Article I, section 8, clause 5 of the United States Constitution delegates to Congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof. This power was delegated to Congress in order to establish and preserve a uniform standard of value and to insure a singular monetary system for all purchases and debts in the United States, public and private. Along with the power to coin money, the United States Congress has the concurrent power to restrain the circulation of money which is not issued under its own authority in order to protect and preserve the constitutional currency. It is a violation of federal law for individuals, or organizations to create private coin or currency systems to compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States.[17]\nCommonly a central bank has the exclusive power to issue all forms of currency, including coins and banknotes (fiat money), and to restrain the circulation alternative currencies for its own area of circulation (a country or group of countries); it regulates the production of currency by banks (credit) through monetary policy.\nAn exchange rate is a price at which two currencies can be exchanged against each other. This is used for trade between the two currency zones. Exchange rates can be classified as either floating or fixed. In the former, day-to-day movements in exchange rates are determined by the market; in the latter, governments intervene in the market to buy or sell their currency to balance supply and demand at a static exchange rate.\nIn cases where a country has control of its own currency, that control is exercised either by a central bank or by a Ministry of Finance. The institution that has control of monetary policy is referred to as the monetary authority. Monetary authorities have varying degrees of autonomy from the governments that create them. A monetary authority is created and supported by its sponsoring government, so independence can be reduced by the legislative or executive authority that creates it.\nSeveral countries can use the same name for their own separate currencies (for example, a dollar in Australia, Canada, and the United States). By contrast, several countries can also use the same currency (for example, the euro or the CFA franc), or one country can declare the currency of another country to be legal tender. For example, Panama and El Salvador have declared US currency to be legal tender, and from 1791 to 1857, Spanish dollars were legal tender in the United States. At various times countries have either re-stamped foreign coins or used currency boards, issuing one note of currency for each note of a foreign government held, as Ecuador currently does.\nEach currency typically has a main currency unit (the dollar, for example, or the euro) and a fractional unit, often defined as 1⁄100 of the main unit: 100 cents = 1 dollar, 100 centimes = 1 franc, 100 pence = 1 pound, although units of 1⁄10 or 1⁄1000 occasionally also occur. Some currencies do not have any smaller units at all, such as the Icelandic króna and the Japanese yen.\nMauritania and Madagascar are the only remaining countries that have theoretical fractional units not based on the decimal system; instead, the Mauritanian ouguiya is in theory divided into 5 khoums, while the Malagasy ariary is theoretically divided into 5 iraimbilanja. In these countries, words like dollar or pound \"were simply names for given weights of gold\".[19] Due to inflation khoums and iraimbilanja have in practice fallen into disuse. (See non-decimal currencies for other historic currencies with non-decimal divisions.)\nSubject to variation around the world, local currency can be converted to another currency or vice versa with or without central bank/government intervention. Such conversions take place in the foreign exchange market. Based on the above restrictions or free and readily conversion features, currencies are classified as:\nAccording to the three aspects of trade in goods and services, capital flows and national policies, the supply-demand relationship of different currencies determines the exchange ratio between currencies.\nTrade in goods and services\nThrough cost transfer, goods and services circulating in the country (such as hotels, tourism, catering, advertising, household services) will indirectly affect the trade cost of goods and services and the price of export trade. Therefore, services and goods involved in international trade are not the only reason affecting the exchange rate. The large number of international tourists and overseas students has resulted in the flow of services and goods at home and abroad. It also represents that the competitiveness of global goods and services directly affects the change of international exchange rates.\nCapital flows\nNational currencies will be traded on international markets for investment purposes. Investment opportunities in each country attract other countries into investment programs, so that these foreign currencies become the reserves of the central banks of each country. The exchange rate mechanism, in which currencies are quoted continuously between countries, is based on foreign exchange markets in which currencies are invested by individuals and traded or speculated by central banks and investment institutions. In addition, changes in interest rates, capital market fluctuations and changes in investment opportunities will affect the global capital inflows and outflows of countries around the world, and exchange rates will fluctuate accordingly.\nNational policies\nThe country's foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies affect the exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign trade includes policies such as tariffs and import standards for commodity exports. The impact of monetary policy on the total amount and yield of money directly determines the changes in the international exchange rate. Fiscal policies, such as transfer payments, taxation ratios, and other factors, dominate the profitability of capital and economic development, and the ratio of national debt issuance to deficit determines the repayment capacity and credit rating of the country. Such policies determine the mechanism of linking domestic and foreign currencies and therefore have a significant impact on the generation of exchange rates.\nCurrency convertibility is closely linked to economic development and finance. There are strict conditions for countries to achieve currency convertibility, which is a good way for countries to improve their economies. The currencies of some countries or regions in the world are freely convertible, such as the US dollar, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The requirements for currency convertibility can be roughly divided into four parts:\nWith a freely convertible currency, domestic firms will have to compete fiercely with their foreign counterparts. The development of competition among them will affect the implementation effect of currency convertibility. In addition, microeconomics is a prerequisite for macroeconomic conditions.\nSince currency convertibility is the cross-border flow of goods and capital, it will have an impact on the macro economy. This requires that the national economy be in a normal and orderly state, that is, there is no serious inflation and economic overheating. In addition, the government should use macro policies to make mature adjustments to deal with the impact of currency exchange on the economy.\nThe maintainability of international balance of payments is the main performance of reasonable economic structure. Currency convertibility not only causes difficulties in the sustainability of international balance of payments but also affects the government's direct control over international economic transactions. To eliminate the foreign exchange shortage, the government needs adequate international reserves.\nThe level of exchange rate is an important factor in maintaining exchange rate stability, both before and after currency convertibility. The exchange rate of freely convertible currency is too high or too low, which can easily trigger speculation and undermine the stability of macroeconomic and financial markets. Therefore, to maintain the level of exchange rate, a proper exchange rate regime is crucial.\nIn economics, a local currency is a currency not backed by a national government and intended to trade only in a small area. Advocates such as Jane Jacobs argue that this enables an economically depressed region to pull itself up, by giving the people living there a medium of exchange that they can use to exchange services and locally produced goods (in a broader sense, this is the original purpose of all money). Opponents of this concept argue that local currency creates a barrier that can interfere with economies of scale and comparative advantage and that in some cases they can serve as a means of tax evasion.\nLocal currencies can also come into being when there is economic turmoil involving the national currency. An example of this is the Argentinian economic crisis of 2002 in which IOUs issued by local governments quickly took on some of the characteristics of local currencies.\nOne of the best examples of a local currency is the original LETS currency, founded on Vancouver Island in the early 1980s.  In 1982, the Canadian Central Bank's lending rates ran up to 14% which drove chartered bank lending rates as high as 19%.  The resulting currency and credit scarcity left island residents with few options other than to create a local currency.[21]\nThe following table are estimates of the 20 most frequently used currencies in world payments in July 2024 by SWIFT.[22]\nRelated concepts\nAccounting units\nLists\n\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Glossary", "ListISO", "StocksBonds", "Money portal", "Chartalism", "Mutualism", "Circuitism", "Lausanne"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses the concept of currency as a medium of exchange, encompassing physical forms like banknotes and coins, as well as digital and alternative forms like cryptocurrency.

{"Entity": "Interest_rate", "Content": "Heterodox\nAn interest rate is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed (called the principal sum). The total interest on an amount lent or borrowed depends on the principal sum, the interest rate, the compounding frequency, and the length of time over which it is lent, deposited, or borrowed.\nThe annual interest rate is the rate over a period of one year. Other interest rates apply over different periods, such as a month or a day, but they are usually annualized.\nThe interest rate has been characterized as \"an index of the preference . . . for a dollar of present [income] over a dollar of future income\".[1] The borrower wants, or needs, to have money sooner, and is willing to pay a fee—the interest rate—for that privilege.\nInterest rates vary according to:\nas well as other factors.\nA company borrows capital from a bank to buy assets for its business. In return, the bank charges the company interest. (The lender might also require rights over the new assets as collateral.)\nA bank will use the capital deposited by individuals to make loans to their clients. In return, the bank should pay interest to individuals who have deposited their capital. The amount of interest payment depends on the interest rate and the amount of capital they deposited.\nBase rate usually refers to the annualized effective interest rate offered on overnight deposits by the central bank or other monetary authority.[citation needed]\nThe annual percentage rate (APR) may refer either to a nominal APR or an effective APR (EAPR). The difference between the two is that the EAPR accounts for fees and compounding, while the nominal APR does not.\nThe annual equivalent rate (AER), also called the effective annual rate, is used to help consumers compare products with different compounding frequencies on a common basis, but does not account for fees.\nA discount rate[2] is applied to calculate present value.\nFor an interest-bearing security, coupon rate is the ratio of the annual coupon amount (the coupon paid per year) per unit of par value, whereas current yield is the ratio of the annual coupon divided by its current market price. Yield to maturity is a bond's expected internal rate of return, assuming it will be held to maturity, that is, the discount rate which equates all remaining cash flows to the investor (all remaining coupons and repayment of the par value at maturity) with the current market price.\nBased on the banking business, there are deposit interest rate and loan interest rate.\nBased on the relationship between supply and demand of market interest rate, there are fixed interest rate and floating interest rate.\nInterest rate targets are a vital tool of monetary policy and are taken into account when dealing with variables like investment, inflation, and unemployment. The central banks of countries generally tend to reduce interest rates when they wish to increase investment and consumption in the country's economy. However, a low interest rate as a macro-economic policy can be risky and may lead to the creation of an economic bubble, in which large amounts of investments are poured into the real-estate market and stock market. In developed economies, interest-rate adjustments are thus made to keep inflation within a target range for the health of economic activities or cap the interest rate concurrently with economic growth to safeguard economic momentum.[3][4][5][6][7]\nIn the past two centuries, interest rates have been variously set either by national governments or central banks. For example, the Federal Reserve federal funds rate in the United States has varied between about 0.25% and 19% from 1954 to 2008, while the Bank of England base rate varied between 0.5% and 15% from 1989 to 2009,[8][9] and Germany experienced rates close to 90% in the 1920s down to about 2% in the 2000s.[10][11] During an attempt to tackle spiraling hyperinflation in 2007, the Central Bank of Zimbabwe increased interest rates for borrowing to 800%.[12]\nThe interest rates on prime credits in the late 1970s and early 1980s were far higher than had been recorded – higher than previous US peaks since 1800, than British peaks since 1700, or than Dutch peaks since 1600; \"since modern capital markets came into existence, there have never been such high long-term rates\" as in this period.[13]\nPossibly before modern capital markets, there have been some accounts that savings deposits could achieve an annual return of at least 25% and up to as high as 50%. (William Ellis and Richard Dawes, \"Lessons on the Phenomenon of Industrial Life... \", 1857, p III–IV)\nThe nominal interest rate is the rate of interest with no adjustment for inflation.\nFor example, suppose someone deposits $100 with a bank for one year, and they receive interest of $10 (before tax), so at the end of the year, their balance is $110 (before tax). In this case, regardless of the rate of inflation, the nominal interest rate is 10% per annum (before tax).\nThe real interest rate measures the growth in real value of the loan plus interest, taking inflation into account. The repayment of principal plus interest is measured in real terms compared against the buying power of the amount at the time it was borrowed, lent, deposited or invested.\nIf inflation is 10%, then the $110 in the account at the end of the year has the same purchasing power (that is, buys the same amount) as the $100 had a year ago. The real interest rate is zero in this case.\nThe real interest rate is given by the Fisher equation:\nwhere p is the inflation rate.For low rates and short periods, the linear approximation applies:\nThe Fisher equation applies both ex ante and ex post. Ex ante, the rates are projected rates, whereas ex post, the rates are historical.\nThere is a market for investments, including the money market, bond market, stock market, and currency market as well as retail banking.\nInterest rates reflect:\nAccording to the theory of rational expectations, borrowers and lenders form an expectation of inflation in the future. The acceptable nominal interest rate at which they are willing and able to borrow or lend includes the real interest rate they require to receive, or are willing and able to pay, plus the rate of inflation they expect.\nThe level of risk in investments is taken into consideration. Riskier investments such as shares and junk bonds are normally expected to deliver higher returns than safer ones like government bonds.\nThe additional return above the risk-free nominal interest rate which is expected from a risky investment is the risk premium. The risk premium an investor requires on an investment depends on the risk preferences of the investor. Evidence suggests that most lenders are risk-averse.[15]\nA maturity risk premium applied to a longer-term investment reflects a higher perceived risk of default.\nThere are four kinds of risk:\nMost investors prefer their money to be in cash rather than in less fungible investments. Cash is on hand to be spent immediately if the need arises, but some investments require time or effort to transfer into spendable form. The preference for cash is known as liquidity preference. A 1-year loan, for instance, is very liquid compared to a 10-year loan. A 10-year US Treasury bond, however, is still relatively liquid because it can easily be sold on the market.\nA basic interest rate pricing model for an asset is\nwhere\nAssuming perfect information, pe is the same for all participants in the market, and the interest rate model simplifies to\nThe spread of interest rates is the lending rate minus the deposit rate.[16] This spread covers operating costs for banks providing loans and deposits. A negative spread is where a deposit rate is higher than the lending rate.[17]\nInterest rates affect economic activity broadly, which is the reason why they are normally the main instrument of the monetary policies conducted by central banks.[18] Changes in interest rates will affect firms' investment behaviour, either raising or lowering the opportunity cost of investing. Interest rate changes also affect asset prices like stock prices and house prices, which again influence households' consumption decisions through a wealth effect. Additionally, international interest rate differentials affect exchange rates and consequently exports and imports. These various channels are collectively known as the monetary transmission mechanism. Consumption, investment and net exports are all important components of aggregate demand. Consequently, by influencing the general interest rate level, monetary policy can affect overall demand for goods and services in the economy and hence output and employment.[19] Changes in employment will over time affect wage setting, which again affects pricing and consequently ultimately inflation. The relation between employment (or unemployment) and inflation is known as the Phillips curve.[18]\nFor economies maintaining a fixed exchange rate system, determining the interest rate is also an important instrument of monetary policy as international capital flows are in part determined by interest rate differentials between countries.[20]\nThe Federal Reserve (often referred to as 'the Fed') implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate (FFR). This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. Until the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Fed relied on open market operations, i.e. selling and buying securities in the open market to adjust the supply of reserve balances so as to keep the FFR close to the Fed's target.[21] However, since 2008 the actual conduct of monetary policy implementation has changed considerably, the Fed using instead various administered interest rates (i.e.,  interest rates that are set directly by the Fed rather than being determined by the market forces of supply and demand) as the primary tools to steer short-term market interest rates towards the Fed's policy target.[22]\nFinancial economists such as World Pensions Council (WPC) researchers have argued that durably low interest rates in most G20 countries will have an adverse impact on the funding positions of pension funds as \"without returns that outstrip inflation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years\".[23] Current interest rates in savings accounts often fail to keep up with the pace of inflation.[24]\nFrom 1982 until 2012, most Western economies experienced a period of low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all asset classes including government bonds. This brought a certain sense of complacency[citation needed] amongst some pension actuarial consultants and regulators, making it seem reasonable to use optimistic economic assumptions to calculate the present value of future pension liabilities.\nBecause interest and inflation are generally given as percentage increases, the formulae above are (linear) approximations.\nFor instance,\nis only approximate. In reality, the relationship is\nso\nThe two approximations, eliminating higher order terms, are:\nThe formulae in this article are exact if logarithmic units are used for relative changes, or equivalently if logarithms of indices are used in place of rates, and hold even for large relative changes.\nA so-called \"zero interest-rate policy\" (ZIRP) is a very low—near-zero—central bank target interest rate. At this zero lower bound the central bank faces difficulties with conventional monetary policy, because it is generally believed that market interest rates cannot realistically be pushed down into negative territory.After the crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at zero for 12 years.[25]\nNominal interest rates are normally positive, but not always. In contrast, real interest rates can be negative, when nominal interest rates are below inflation. When this is done via government policy (for example, via reserve requirements), this is deemed financial repression, and was practiced by countries such as the United States and United Kingdom following World War II (from 1945) until the late 1970s or early 1980s (during and following the Post–World War II economic expansion).[26][27] In the late 1970s, United States Treasury securities with negative real interest rates were deemed certificates of confiscation.[28]\nA so-called \"negative interest rate policy\" (NIRP) is a negative (below zero) central bank target interest rate.\nGiven the alternative of holding cash, and thus earning 0%, rather than lending it out, profit-seeking lenders will not lend below 0%, as that will guarantee a loss, and a bank offering a negative deposit rate will find few takers, as savers will instead hold cash.[29]\nNegative interest rates have been proposed in the past, notably in the late 19th century by Silvio Gesell.[30] A negative interest rate can be described (as by Gesell) as a \"tax on holding money\"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (free economy) system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited the idea of a carrying tax on money,[30] (1936, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties.[31] More recently, a carry tax on currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips on bills, deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the tax being based on how long the bill had been held.[31]\nIt has been proposed that a negative interest rate can in principle be levied on existing paper currency via a serial number lottery, such as randomly choosing a number 0 through 9 and declaring that notes whose serial number end in that digit are worthless, yielding an average 10% loss of paper cash holdings to hoarders; a drawn two-digit number could match the last two digits on the note for a 1% loss. This was proposed by an anonymous student of Greg Mankiw,[30] though more as a thought experiment than a genuine proposal.[32]\nBoth the European Central Bank starting in 2014 and the Bank of Japan starting in early 2016 pursued the policy on top of their earlier and continuing quantitative easing policies. The latter's policy was said at its inception to be trying to \"change Japan's 'deflationary mindset.'\" In 2016 Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland—not directly participants in the Euro currency zone—also had NIRPs in place.[33]\nCountries such as Sweden and Denmark have set negative interest on reserves—that is to say, they have charged interest on reserves.[34][35][36][37]\nIn July 2009, Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, set its policy repo rate, the interest rate on its one-week deposit facility, at 0.25%, at the same time as setting its overnight deposit rate at −0.25%.[38] The existence of the negative overnight deposit rate was a technical consequence of the fact that overnight deposit rates are generally set at 0.5% below or 0.75% below the policy rate.[38][39] The Riksbank studied the impact of these changes and stated in a commentary report[40] that they led to no disruptions in Swedish financial markets.\nDuring the European debt crisis, government bonds of some countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands and Austria) have been sold at negative yields. Suggested explanations include desire for safety and protection against the eurozone breaking up (in which case some eurozone countries might redenominate their debt into a stronger currency).[42]\nFor practical purposes, investors and academics typically view the yields on government or quasi-government bonds guaranteed by a small number of the most creditworthy governments (United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, EU, Japan) to effectively have negligible default risk. As financial theory would predict, investors and academics typically do not view non-government guaranteed corporate bonds in the same way. Most credit analysts value them at a spread to similar government bonds with similar duration, geographic exposure, and currency exposure. Through 2018 there have only been a few of these corporate bonds that have traded at negative nominal interest rates.The most notable example of this was Nestle, some of whose AAA-rated bonds traded at negative nominal interest rate in 2015. However, some academics and investors believe this may have been influenced by volatility in the currency market during this period.\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "institutional", "Lists of banks", "GDPGNINNI", "Endogenous", "Neo-New", "Circuitism", "Applied", "Mutualism", "Circuitism", "Lausanne", "DemandSupply", "Sahm rule"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses various aspects of interest rates, their significance, and the impact on financial markets and economies.

{"Entity": "Annual_percentage_rate", "Content": "The term annual percentage rate of charge (APR),[1][2] corresponding sometimes to a nominal APR and sometimes to an effective APR (EAPR),[3] is the interest rate for a whole year (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, credit card,[4] etc. It is a finance charge expressed as an annual rate.[5][6] Those terms have formal, legal definitions in some countries or legal jurisdictions, but in the United States:[3]\nIn some areas, the annual percentage rate (APR) is the simplified counterpart to the effective interest rate that the borrower will pay on a loan. In many countries and jurisdictions, lenders (such as banks) are required to disclose the \"cost\" of borrowing in some standardized way as a form of consumer protection. The (effective) APR has been intended to make it easier to compare lenders and loan options.\nThe nominal APR is calculated as: the rate, for a payment period, multiplied by the number of payment periods in a year.[3] However, the exact legal definition of \"effective APR\", or EAR, can vary greatly in each jurisdiction, depending on the type of fees included, such as participation fees, loan origination fees, monthly service charges, or late fees. The effective APR has been called the \"mathematically-true\" interest rate for each year.[7][8]\nThe computation for the effective APR, as the fee + compound interest rate, can also vary depending on whether the up-front fees, such as origination or participation fees, are added to the entire amount, or treated as a short-term loan due in the first payment.  When start-up fees are paid as first payment(s), the balance due might accrue more interest, as being delayed by the extra payment period(s).[9]\nThere are at least three ways of computing effective annual percentage rate:\nFor example, consider a $100 loan which must be repaid after one month, plus 5%, plus a $10 fee.  If the fee is not considered, this loan has an effective APR of approximately 80% (1.0512 = 1.7959, which is approximately an 80% increase). If the $10 fee were considered, the monthly interest increases by 10% ($10/$100), and the effective APR becomes approximately 435% (1.1512 = 5.3503, which equals a 435% increase).  Hence there are at least two possible \"effective APRs\": 80% and 435%.  Laws vary as to whether fees must be included in APR calculations.\nIn the U.S., the calculation and disclosure of APR is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (which is implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in Regulation Z of the Act). In general, APR in the United States is expressed as the periodic (for instance, monthly) interest rate times the number of compounding periods in a year[10] (also known as the nominal interest rate); since the APR must include certain non-interest charges and fees, it requires more detailed calculation. The APR must be disclosed to the borrower within 3 days of applying for a mortgage. This information is typically mailed to the borrower and the APR is found on the truth in lending disclosure statement, which also includes an amortization schedule.\nOn July 30, 2009, provisions of the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (MDIA) came into effect.[11] A specific clause of this act refers directly to APR disclosure on mortgages. It states, if the final annual percentage rate APR is off by more than 0.125% from the initial GFE disclosure, then the lender must re-disclose and wait another three business days before closing on the transaction.\nThe calculation for \"close-ended credit\" (such as a home mortgage or auto loan) can be found here. For a fixed-rate mortgage, the APR is thus equal to its internal rate of return (or yield) under an assumption of zero prepayment and zero default. For an adjustable-rate mortgage the APR will also depend on the particular assumption regarding the prospective trajectory of the index rate.\nThe calculation for \"open-ended credit\" (such as a credit card, home equity loan or other line of credit) can be found here.\nIn the EU, the focus of APR standardization is heavily on transparency and consumer rights: «a comprehensible set of information to be given to consumers in good time before the contract is concluded and also as part of the credit agreement [...] every creditor has to use this form when marketing a consumer credit in any Member State» so marketing different figures is not allowed.\nThe EU regulations were reinforced with directives 2008/48/EC and 2011/90/EU, fully in force in all member states since 2013.[12]However, in the UK the EU directive has been interpreted as the Representative APR.\nA single method of calculating the APR was introduced in 1998 (directive 98/7/EC) and is required to be published for the major part of loans. Using the improved notation of directive 2008/48/EC, the basic equation for calculation of APR in the EU is:\nIn this equation the left side is the present value of the drawdowns made by the lender and the right side is the present value of the repayments made by the borrower. In both cases the present value is defined given the APR as the interest rate. So the present value of the drawdowns is equal to the present value of the repayments, given the APR as the interest rate.\nNote that neither the amounts nor the periods between transactions are necessarily equal.  For the purposes of this calculation, a year is presumed to have 365 days (366 days for leap years), 52 weeks or 12 equal months. As per the standard: \"An equal month is presumed to have 30.41666 days (i.e. 365/12) regardless of whether or not it is a leap year.\"  The result is to be expressed to at least one decimal place.  This algorithm for APR is required for some but not all forms of consumer debt in the EU.  For example, this EU directive is limited to agreements of €50,000 and below and excludes all mortgages.[13]\nIn the Netherlands the formula above is also used for mortgages. In many cases the mortgage is not always paid back completely at the end of period N, but for instance when the borrower sells his house or dies. In addition, there is usually only one payment of the lender to the borrower: in the beginning of the loan. In that case the formula becomes:\nIf the length of the periods are equal (monthly payments) then the summations can be simplified using the formula for a geometric series. Either way, the APR can be solved iteratively only from the formulas above, apart from trivial cases such as N=1.\nAn effective annual interest rate of 10% can also be expressed in several ways:\nThese rates are all equivalent, but to a consumer who is not trained in the mathematics of finance, this can be confusing. APR helps to standardize how interest rates are compared, so that a 10% loan is not made to look cheaper by calling it a loan at \"9.1% annually in advance\".\nThe APR does not necessarily convey the total amount of interest paid over the course of a year: if one pays part of the interest prior to the end of the year,  the total amount of interest paid is less.\nIn the case of a loan with no fees, the amortization schedule would be worked out by taking the principal left at the end of each month, multiplying by the monthly rate and then subtracting the monthly payment.\nThis can be expressed mathematically by\nThis also explains why a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage with the same APR would have different monthly payments and a different total amount of interest paid. There are many more periods over which to spread the principal, which makes the payment smaller, but there are just as many periods over which to charge interest at the same rate, which makes the total amount of interest paid much greater. For example, $100,000 mortgaged (without fees, since they add into the calculation in a different way) over 15 years costs a total of $193,429.80 (interest is 93.430% of principal), but over 30 years, costs a total of $315,925.20 (interest is 215.925% of principal).\nIn addition the APR takes costs into account.  Suppose for instance that $100,000 is borrowed with $1000 one-time fees paid in advance.  If, in the second case, equal monthly payments are made of $946.01 against 9.569% compounded monthly then it takes 240 months to pay the loan back. If the $1000 one-time fees are taken into account then the yearly interest rate paid is effectively equal to 10.31%.\nThe APR concept can also be applied to savings accounts: imagine a savings account with 1% costs at each withdrawal and again 9.569% interest compounded monthly.  Suppose that the complete amount including the interest is withdrawn after exactly one year.  Then, taking this 1% fee into account, the savings effectively earned 8.9% interest that year.\nThe APR can also be represented by a money factor (also known as the lease factor, lease rate, or factor). The money factor is usually given as a decimal, for example .0030. To find the equivalent APR, the money factor is multiplied by 2400. A money factor of .0030 is equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.6% and an APR of 7.2%.[14]\nFor a leasing arrangement with an initial capital cost of C, a residual value at the end of the lease of F and a monthly interest rate of r, monthly interest starts at Cr and decreases almost linearly during the term of the lease to a final value of Fr.[15] The total amount of interest paid over the lease term of N months is therefore\nand the average interest amount per month is\nThis amount is called the \"monthly finance fee\".[16] The factor r/2 is called the \"money factor\"\nDespite repeated attempts by regulators to establish usable and consistent standards, APR does not represent the total cost of borrowing in some jurisdictions nor does it really create a comparable standard across jurisdictions. Nevertheless, it is considered a reasonable starting point for an ad hoc comparison of lenders.\nCredit card holders should be aware that most U.S. credit cards are quoted in terms of nominal APR compounded monthly, which is not the same as the effective annual rate (EAR). Despite the word \"annual\" in APR, it is not necessarily a direct reference for the interest rate paid on a stable balance over one year. The more direct reference for the one-year rate of interest is EAR.The general conversion factor for APR to EAR isEAR=(1+APRn)n−1{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {EAR} =(1+{\\tfrac {\\mathrm {APR} }{n}})^{n}-1},where n represents the number of compounding periods of the APR per EAR period.As an example, for a common credit card quoted at 12.99% APR compounded monthly, the one year EAR is(1+0.12994912)12−1{\\displaystyle (1+{\\tfrac {0.129949}{12}})^{12}-1},or 13.7975%.For 12.99% APR compounded daily, the EAR paid on a stable balance over one year becomes 13.87%  (where  the .000049 addition to the 12.99% APR is possible because the new rate does not exceed the advertised APR [citation needed]).  Note that a high U.S. APR of 29.99% compounded monthly carries an effective annual rate of 34.48%.\nWhile the difference between APR and EAR may seem trivial, because of the exponential nature of interest these small differences can have a large effect over the life of a loan.  For example, consider a 30-year loan of $200,000 with a stated APR of 10.00%, i.e., 10.0049% APR or the EAR equivalent of 10.4767%.  The monthly payments, using APR, would be $1755.87.  However, using an EAR of 10.00% the monthly payment would be $1691.78.  The difference between the EAR and APR amounts to a difference of $64.09 per month.  Over the life of a 30-year loan, this amounts to $23,070.86, which is over 11% of the original loan amount.\nSome classes of fees are deliberately not included in the calculation of APR. Because these fees are not included, some consumer advocates claim that the APR does not represent the total cost of borrowing. Excluded fees may include:\nLenders argue that the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a pass-through cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and not a part of the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.\nLenders argue that including late fees and other conditional charges would require them to make assumptions about the consumer's behavior – assumptions which would bias the resulting calculation and create more confusion than clarity.\nEven beyond the non-included cost components listed above, regulators have been unable to completely define which one-time fees must be included and which excluded from the calculation. This leaves the lender with some discretion to determine which fees will be included (or not) in the calculation.\nConsumers can, of course, use the nominal interest rate and any costs on the loan (or savings account) and compute the APR themselves, for instance using one of the calculators on the internet.\nIn the example of a mortgage loan, the following kinds of fees are:\nThe discretion that is illustrated in the \"sometimes included\" column even in the highly regulated U.S. home mortgage environment makes it difficult to simply compare the APRs of two lenders. Note: U.S. regulators generally require a lender to use the same assumptions and definitions in their calculation of APR for each of their products even though they cannot force consistency across lenders.\nWith respect to items that may be sold with vendor financing, for example, automobile leasing, the notional cost of the good may effectively be hidden and the APR subsequently rendered meaningless. An example is a case where an automobile is leased to a customer based on a \"manufacturer's suggested retail price\" with a low APR: the vendor may be accepting a lower lease rate as a trade-off against a higher sale price. Had the customer self-financed, a discounted sales price may have been accepted by the vendor; in other words, the customer has received cheap financing in exchange for paying a higher purchase price, and the quoted APR understates the true cost of the financing. In this case, the only meaningful way to establish the \"true\" APR would involve arranging financing through other sources, determining the lowest-acceptable cash price and comparing the financing terms (which may not be feasible in all circumstances). For leases where the lessee has a purchase option at the end of the lease term, the cost of the APR is further complicated by this option. In effect, the lease includes a put option back to the manufacturer (or, alternatively, a call option for the consumer), and the value (or cost) of this option to the consumer is not transparent.\nAPR is dependent on the time period for which the loan is calculated. That is, the APR for a 30-year loan cannot be compared to the APR for a 20-year loan. APR can be used to show the relative impact of different payment schedules (such as balloon payments or biweekly payments instead of straight monthly payments), but most standard APR calculators have difficulty with those calculations.\nFurthermore, most APR calculators assume that an individual will keep a particular loan until the end of the defined repayment period, resulting in the up-front fixed closing costs being amortized over the full term of the loan.  If the consumer pays the loan off early, the effective interest rate achieved will be significantly higher than the APR initially calculated.  This is especially problematic for mortgage loans, where typical loan repayment periods are 15 or 30 years but where many borrowers move or refinance before the loan period runs out, which increases the borrower's effective cost for any points or other origination fees.\nIn theory, this factor should not affect any individual consumer's ability to compare the APR of the same product (same repayment period and origination fees) across vendors. APR may not, however, be particularly helpful when attempting to compare different products, or similar products with different terms.\nSince the principal loan balance is not paid down during the interest-only term, assuming there are no set up costs, the APR will be the same as the interest rate.\nThree lenders with identical information may still calculate different APRs. The calculations can be quite complex and are poorly understood even by most financial professionals. Most users depend on software packages to calculate APR and are therefore dependent on the assumptions in that particular software package. While differences between software packages will not result in large variations, there are several acceptable methods of calculating APR, each of which returns a slightly different result.\nWhile the APR provides a useful means to compare the cost of borrowing across different loan and credit offers, it has several limitations that may affect its accuracy and relevance for certain types of loans.\nThere are instances where APR may be misleading or an inaccurate measure of borrowing costs. It is argued that the APR can be misleading when applied to small-dollar loans, such as payday loans, because it does not accurately represent the true cost of borrowing for short-term financial products. While effective for comparing costs of longer-term loans, APR exaggerates the expense associated with short-term, small-dollar loans, thus potentially misleading consumers about the actual costs they will incur. [17]\nIn a paper by Thomas W. Miller Jr. at the Mercatus Center, it is highlighted that while interest rate caps are often proposed as a means to combat \"predatory\" lending practices associated with high APRs on small-dollar loans, such regulatory measures overlook potential adverse effects. The analysis suggests that a 36 percent interest rate cap could lead to a scarcity of available loans, as the caps may cause demand to surpass supply and prompt lenders to redirect capital away from small-dollar lending markets. This shift could effectively result in an implicit prohibition of products like payday loans by rendering them financially unsustainable.[18]\nAPR may not accurately reflect the cost of borrowing for certain mortgage types, such as those with non-standard repayment structures. APR calculations, which aim to provide a comprehensive cost measure by including interest rates and other fees, might not capture the complexities or the true costs of mortgages that deviate from traditional, fixed-rate, amortizing loans. This discrepancy arises because APR is designed under the assumption of a standard loan structure, potentially misleading consumers about the financial implications of mortgages with variable rates, interest-only periods, or other unique features.[19]\nAPR does not encompass all fees associated with a loan, particularly \"junk fees.\" These excluded fees can include various types of non-interest charges such as certain closing costs, which are not reflected in the APR calculation. This exclusion can mislead consumers about the true cost of borrowing, as the APR presents a narrower scope of expenses than what the borrower may eventually pay.

{"Entity": "Compound_interest", "Content": "Compound interest is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower.\nCompound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period. Compounded interest depends on the simple interest rate applied and the frequency at which the interest is compounded.\nThe compounding frequency is the number of times per given unit of time the accumulated interest is capitalized, on a regular basis. The frequency could be yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, continuously, or not at all until maturity.\nFor example, monthly capitalization with interest expressed as an annual rate means that the compounding frequency is 12, with time periods measured in months.\nTo help consumers compare retail financial products more fairly and easily, many countries require financial institutions to disclose the annual compound interest rate on deposits or advances on a comparable basis. The interest rate on an annual equivalent basis may be referred to variously in different markets as effective annual percentage rate (EAPR), annual equivalent rate (AER), effective interest rate, effective annual rate, annual percentage yield  and other terms. The effective annual rate is the total accumulated interest that would be payable up to the end of one year, divided by the principal sum. These rates are usually the annualised compound interest rate alongside charges other than interest, such as taxes and other fees.\nCompound interest when charged by lenders was once regarded as the worst kind of usury and was severely condemned by Roman law and the common laws of many other countries.[2]\nThe Florentine merchant Francesco Balducci Pegolotti provided a table of compound interest in his book Pratica della mercatura of about 1340. It gives the interest on 100 lire, for rates from 1% to 8%, for up to 20 years.[3] The Summa de arithmetica of Luca Pacioli (1494) gives the Rule of 72, stating that to find the number of years for an investment at compound interest to double, one should divide the interest rate into 72.\nRichard Witt's book Arithmeticall Questions, published in 1613, was a landmark in the history of compound interest. It was wholly devoted to the subject (previously called anatocism), whereas previous writers had usually treated compound interest briefly in just one chapter in a mathematical textbook. Witt's book gave tables based on 10% (the maximum rate of interest allowable on loans) and other rates for different purposes, such as the valuation of property leases. Witt was a London mathematical practitioner and his book is notable for its clarity of expression, depth of insight, and accuracy of calculation, with 124 worked examples.[4][5]\nJacob Bernoulli discovered the constant e{\\displaystyle e} in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest.\nIn the 19th century, and possibly earlier, Persian merchants used a slightly modified linear Taylor approximation to the monthly payment formula that could be computed easily in their heads.[6]In modern times, Albert Einstein's supposed quote regarding compound interest rings true. \"He who understands it earns it; he who doesn't pays it.\"[7]\nThe total accumulated value, including the principal sum P{\\displaystyle P} plus compounded interest I{\\displaystyle I}, is given by the formula:[8][9]A=P(1+rn)nt{\\displaystyle A=P\\left(1+{\\frac {r}{n}}\\right)^{nt}}\nwhere:\nThe total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal:[10]\nI=P(1+rn)nt−P{\\displaystyle I=P\\left(1+{\\frac {r}{n}}\\right)^{nt}-P}\nSince the principal P is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting accumulation function is used instead. The accumulation function shows what $1 grows to after any length of time. The accumulation function for compound interest is:a(t)=(1+rn)nt{\\displaystyle a(t)=\\left(1+{\\frac {r}{n}}\\right)^{nt}}\nWhen the number of compounding periods per year increases without limit, continuous compounding occurs, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of er − 1. Continuous compounding can be regarded as letting the compounding period become infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as n goes to infinity. The amount after t periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount P0 as:\nP(t)=P0ert.{\\displaystyle P(t)=P_{0}e^{rt}.}\nAs the number of compounding periods n{\\displaystyle n} tends to infinity in continuous compounding, the continuous compound interest rate is referred to as the force of interest δ{\\displaystyle \\delta }. For any continuously differentiable accumulation function a(t), the force of interest, or more generally the logarithmic or continuously compounded return, is a function of time as follows:\nδt=a′(t)a(t)=ddtln⁡a(t){\\displaystyle \\delta _{t}={\\frac {a'(t)}{a(t)}}={\\frac {d}{dt}}\\ln a(t)}\nThis is the logarithmic derivative of the accumulation function.\nConversely:a(t)=e∫0tδsds,{\\displaystyle a(t)=e^{\\int _{0}^{t}\\delta _{s}\\,ds}\\,,} (Since a(0)=1{\\displaystyle a(0)=1}, this can be viewed as a particular case of a product integral.)\nWhen the above formula is written in differential equation format, then the force of interest is simply the coefficient of amount of change:da(t)=δta(t)dt{\\displaystyle da(t)=\\delta _{t}a(t)\\,dt}\nFor compound interest with a constant annual interest rate r, the force of interest is a constant, and the accumulation function of compounding interest in terms of force of interest is a simple power of e:δ=ln⁡(1+r){\\displaystyle \\delta =\\ln(1+r)} ora(t)=etδ{\\displaystyle a(t)=e^{t\\delta }}\nThe force of interest is less than the annual effective interest rate, but more than the annual effective discount rate. It is the reciprocal of the e-folding time.\nA way of modeling the force of inflation is with Stoodley's formula: δt=p+s1+rsest{\\displaystyle \\delta _{t}=p+{s \\over {1+rse^{st}}}} where p, r and s are estimated.\nTo convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, so that\n(1+r1n1)n1=(1+r2n2)n2{\\displaystyle \\left(1+{\\frac {r_{1}}{n_{1}}}\\right)^{n_{1}}=\\left(1+{\\frac {r_{2}}{n_{2}}}\\right)^{n_{2}}}\nuse\nr2=[(1+r1n1)n1n2−1]n2,{\\displaystyle r_{2}=\\left[\\left(1+{\\frac {r_{1}}{n_{1}}}\\right)^{\\frac {n_{1}}{n_{2}}}-1\\right]{n_{2}},}\nwhere r1 is the interest rate with compounding frequency n1, and r2 is the interest rate with compounding frequency n2.\nWhen interest is continuously compounded, use\nδ=nln⁡(1+rn),{\\displaystyle \\delta =n\\ln {\\left(1+{\\frac {r}{n}}\\right)},}\nwhere δ{\\displaystyle \\delta } is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, andr is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency n.\nThe interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized—that is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off—is often compounded monthly.

If required, the interest on additional non-recurring and recurring deposits can also be defined within the same formula (see below).[11]\nThe compound interest for each deposit is:M′=M(1+r)t{\\displaystyle M'=M(1+r)^{t}}Adding all recurring deposits over the total period t, (i starts at 0 if deposits begin with the investment of principal; i starts at 1 if deposits begin the next month):M′=∑i=0t−1M(1+r)t−i{\\displaystyle M'=\\sum _{i=0}^{t-1}{M(1+r)^{t-i}}}Recognizing the geometric series: M′=M∑i=0t−1(1+r)t1(1+r)i{\\displaystyle M'=M\\sum _{i=0}^{t-1}(1+r)^{t}{\\frac {1}{(1+r)^{i}}}} and applying the closed-form formula (common ratio :1/(1+r){\\displaystyle 1/(1+r)}):\nP′=M(1+r)t−1r+P(1+r)t{\\displaystyle P'=M{\\frac {(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}}+P(1+r)^{t}}\nIf two or more types of deposits occur (either recurring or non-recurring), the compound value earned can be represented as\nValue=M(1+r)t−1r+P(1+r)t+k(1+r)t−x−1r+C(1+r)t−y{\\displaystyle {\\text{Value}}=M{\\frac {(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}}+P(1+r)^{t}+k{\\frac {(1+r)^{t-x}-1}{r}}+C(1+r)^{t-y}}\nwhere C is each lump sum and k are non-monthly recurring deposits, respectively, and x and y are the differences in time between a new deposit and the total period t is modeling.\nA practical estimate for reverse calculation of the rate of return when the exact date and amount of each recurring deposit is not known, a formula that assumes a uniform recurring monthly deposit over the period, is:[12]r=(P′−P−∑MP+∑M/2)1/t{\\displaystyle r=\\left({\\frac {P'-P-\\sum {M}}{P+\\sum {M}/2}}\\right)^{1/t}} or r=(P′−∑M/2P+∑M/2)1/t−1{\\displaystyle r=\\left({\\frac {P'-\\sum {M}/2}{P+\\sum {M}/2}}\\right)^{1/t}-1}\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": ""}
{"Entity": "Time_value_of_money", "Content": "The time value of money is the widely accepted conjecture that there is greater benefit to receiving a sum of money now rather than an identical sum later. It may be seen as an implication of the later-developed concept of time preference.\nThe time value of money refers to the observation that it is better to receive money sooner than later. Money you have today can be invested to earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow. Therefore, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.[1]\nThe time value of money is among the factors considered when weighing the opportunity costs of spending rather than saving or investing money.  As such, it is among the reasons why interest is paid or earned: interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the loss of their use of their money. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable net return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset both the preference to spending money now and inflation (if present); see required rate of return.\nThe Talmud (~500 CE) recognizes the time value of money. In Tractate Makkos page 3a the Talmud discusses a case where witnesses falsely claimed that the term of a loan was 30 days when it was actually 10 years. The false witnesses must pay the difference of the value of the loan \"in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) thirty days..., and that same sum in a situation where he would be required to give the money back (within) 10 years...The difference is the sum that the testimony of the (false) witnesses sought to have the borrower lose; therefore, it is the sum that they must pay.\"[2]\nThe notion was later described by Martín de Azpilcueta (1491–1586) of the School of Salamanca.\nTime value of money problems involve the net value of cash flows at different points in time.\nIn a typical case, the variables might be: a balance (the real or nominal value of a debt or a financial asset in terms of monetary units), a periodic rate of interest, the number of periods, and a series of cash flows. (In the case of a debt, cash flows are payments against principal and interest; in the case of a financial asset, these are contributions to or withdrawals from the balance.)  More generally, the cash flows may not be periodic but may be specified individually. Any of these variables may be the independent variable (the sought-for answer) in a given problem. For example, one may know that: the interest is 0.5% per period (per month, say); the number of periods is 60 (months); the initial balance (of the debt, in this case) is 25,000 units; and the final balance is 0 units.  The unknown variable may be the monthly payment that the borrower must pay.\nFor example, £100 invested for one year, earning 5% interest, will be worth £105 after one year; therefore, £100 paid now and £105 paid exactly one year later both have the same value to a recipient who expects 5% interest assuming that inflation would be zero percent. That is, £100 invested for one year at 5% interest has a future value of £105 under the assumption that inflation would be zero percent.[3]\nThis principle allows for the valuation of a likely stream of income in the future, in such a way that annual incomes are discounted and then added together, thus providing a lump-sum \"present value\" of the entire income stream; all of the standard calculations for time value of money derive from the most basic algebraic expression for the present value of a future sum, \"discounted\" to the present by an amount equal to the time value of money. For example, the future value sum FV{\\displaystyle FV} to be received in one year is discounted at the rate of interest r{\\displaystyle r} to give the present value sum PV{\\displaystyle PV}:\nSome standard calculations based on the time value of money are:\nThere are several basic equations that represent the equalities listed above. The solutions may be found using (in most cases) the formulas, a financial calculator or a spreadsheet. The formulas are programmed into most financial calculators and several spreadsheet functions (such as PV, FV, RATE, NPER, and PMT).[8]\nFor any of the equations below, the formula may also be rearranged to determine one of the other unknowns. In the case of the standard annuity formula, there is no closed-form algebraic solution for the interest rate (although financial calculators and spreadsheet programs can readily determine solutions through rapid trial and error algorithms).\nThese equations are frequently combined for particular uses. For example, bonds can be readily priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital at the end of the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.\nAn important note is that the interest rate i is the interest rate for the relevant period. For an annuity that makes one payment per year, i will be the annual interest rate. For an income or payment stream with a different payment schedule, the interest rate must be converted into the relevant periodic interest rate. For example, a monthly rate for a mortgage with monthly payments requires that the interest rate be divided by 12 (see the example below). See compound interest for details on converting between different periodic interest rates.\nThe rate of return in the calculations can be either the variable solved for, or a predefined variable that measures a discount rate, interest, inflation, rate of return, cost of equity, cost of debt or any number of other analogous concepts. The choice of the appropriate rate is critical to the exercise, and the use of an incorrect discount rate will make the results meaningless.\nFor calculations involving annuities, it must be decided whether the payments are made at the end of each period (known as an ordinary annuity), or at the beginning of each period (known as an annuity due). When using a financial calculator or a spreadsheet, it can usually be set for either calculation. The following formulas are for an ordinary annuity. For the answer for the present value of an annuity due, the PV of an ordinary annuity can be multiplied by (1 + i).\nThe following formula use these common variables:\nThe future value  (FV)  formula is similar and uses the same variables.\nThe present value formula is the core formula for the time value of money; each of the other formulas is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.\nThe present value (PV) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:\nThe cumulative present value of future cash flows can be calculated by summing the contributions of FVt, the value of cash flow at time t:\nNote that this series can be summed for a given value of n, or when n is ∞.[9] This is a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below.\nIn this case the cash flow values remain the same throughout the n periods. The present value of an annuity (PVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:\nTo get the PV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).\nIn this case each cash flow grows by a factor of (1+g). Similar to the formula for an annuity, the present value of a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same variables with the addition of g as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.\nWhere i ≠ g :\nWhere i = g :\nTo get the PV of a growing annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).\nA perpetuity is payments of a set amount of money that occur on a routine basis and continue forever. When n → ∞, the PV of a perpetuity (a perpetual annuity) formula becomes a simple division.\nWhen the perpetual annuity payment grows at a fixed rate (g, with g < i) the value is determined according to the following formula, obtained by setting n to infinity in the earlier formula for a growing perpetuity:\nIn practice, there are few securities with precise characteristics, and the application of this valuation approach is subject to various qualifications and modifications. Most importantly, it is rare to find a growing perpetual annuity with fixed rates of growth and true perpetual cash flow generation. Despite these qualifications, the general approach may be used in valuations of real estate, equities, and other assets.\nThis is the well known Gordon growth model used for stock valuation.\nThe future value (after n periods) of an annuity (FVA) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:\nTo get the FV of an annuity due, multiply the above equation by (1 + i).\nThe future value (after n periods) of a growing annuity (FVA) formula has five variables, each of which can be solved for by numerical methods:\nWhere i ≠ g :\nWhere i = g :\nThe following table summarizes the different formulas commonly used in calculating the time value of money.[10] These values are often displayed in tables where the interest rate and time are specified.\nIncreasing percentage (g)\nF=D⋅n(1+i)n1+g{\\displaystyle F=D\\cdot {\\frac {n(1+i)^{n}}{1+g}}}   (for i = g)\nIncreasing percentage (g)\nP=D⋅n1+g{\\displaystyle P=D\\cdot {\\frac {n}{1+g}}}   (for i = g)\nNotes:\nThe formula for the present value of a regular stream of future payments (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where C is the payment amount and n the period.\nA single payment C at future time m has the following future value at future time n:\nSumming over all payments from time 1 to time n, then reversing t\nNote that this is a geometric series, with the initial value being a = C, the multiplicative factor being 1 + i, with n terms. Applying the formula for geometric series, we get\nThe present value of the annuity (PVA) is obtained by simply dividing by (1+i)n{\\displaystyle (1+i)^{n}}:\nAnother simple and intuitive way to derive the future value of an annuity is to consider an endowment, whose interest is paid as the annuity, and whose principal remains constant. The principal of this hypothetical endowment can be computed as that whose interest equals the annuity payment amount:\nNote that no money enters or leaves the combined system of endowment principal + accumulated annuity payments, and thus the future value of this system can be computed simply via the future value formula:\nInitially, before any payments, the present value of the system is just the endowment principal, PV=Ci{\\displaystyle PV={\\frac {C}{i}}}. At the end, the future value is the endowment principal (which is the same) plus the future value of the total annuity payments (FV=Ci+FVA{\\displaystyle FV={\\frac {C}{i}}+FVA}). Plugging this back into the equation:\nWithout showing the formal derivation here, the perpetuity formula is derived from the annuity formula. Specifically, the term:\ncan be seen to approach the value of 1 as n grows larger. At infinity, it is equal to 1, leaving Ci{\\displaystyle {C \\over i}} as the only term remaining.\nRates are sometimes converted into the continuous compound interest rate equivalent because the continuous equivalent is more convenient (for example, more easily differentiated). Each of the formulas above may be restated in their continuous equivalents. For example, the present value at time 0 of a future payment at time t can be restated in the following way, where e is the base of the natural logarithm and r is the continuously compounded rate:\nThis can be generalized to discount rates that vary over time: instead of a constant discount rate r, one uses a function of time r(t). In that case the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time T is given by the integral of the continuously compounded rate r(t):\nIndeed, a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, as detailed below.\nUsing continuous compounding yields the following formulas for various instruments:\nThese formulas assume that payment A is made in the first payment period and annuity ends at time t.[11]\nOrdinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) — equations involving derivatives and one (respectively, multiple) variables are ubiquitous in more advanced treatments of financial mathematics. While time value of money can be understood without using the framework of differential equations, the added sophistication sheds additional light on time value, and provides a simple introduction before considering more complicated and less familiar situations. This exposition follows (Carr & Flesaker 2006, pp. 6–7).\nThe fundamental change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a number (the present value now), one computes a function (the present value now or at any point in future). This function may then be analyzed — how does its value change over time? — or compared with other functions.\nFormally, the statement that \"value decreases over time\" is given by defining the linear differential operator L{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}} as:\nThis states that value decreases (−) over time (∂t) at the discount rate (r(t)). Applied to a function it yields:\nFor an instrument whose payment stream is described by f(t), the value V(t) satisfies the inhomogeneous first-order ODE LV=f{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}V=f} (\"inhomogeneous\" is because one has f rather than 0, and \"first-order\" is because one has first derivatives but no higher derivatives) — this encodes the fact that when any cash flow occurs, the value of the instrument changes by the value of the cash flow (if you receive a £10 coupon, the remaining value decreases by exactly £10).\nThe standard technique tool in the analysis of ODEs is Green's functions, from which other solutions can be built. In terms of time value of money, the Green's function (for the time value ODE) is the value of a bond paying £1 at a single point in time u — the value of any other stream of cash flows can then be obtained by taking combinations of this basic cash flow. In mathematical terms, this instantaneous cash flow is modeled as a Dirac delta function δu(t):=δ(t−u).{\\displaystyle \\delta _{u}(t):=\\delta (t-u).}\nThe Green's function for the value at time t of a £1 cash flow at time u is\nwhere H is the Heaviside step function – the notation \";u{\\displaystyle ;u}\" is to emphasize that u is a parameter (fixed in any instance — the time when the cash flow will occur), while t is a variable (time). In other words, future cash flows are exponentially discounted (exp) by the sum (integral, ∫{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\int }}) of the future discount rates (∫tu{\\displaystyle \\textstyle {\\int _{t}^{u}}} for future, r(v) for discount rates), while past cash flows are worth 0 (H(u−t)=1 if t<u,0 if t>u{\\displaystyle H(u-t)=1{\\text{ if }}t<u,0{\\text{ if }}t>u}), because they have already occurred. Note that the value at the moment of a cash flow is not well-defined — there is a discontinuity at that point, and one can use a convention (assume cash flows have already occurred, or not already occurred), or simply not define the value at that point.\nIn case the discount rate is constant, r(v)≡r,{\\displaystyle r(v)\\equiv r,} this simplifies to\nwhere (u−t){\\displaystyle (u-t)} is \"time remaining until cash flow\".\nThus for a stream of cash flows f(u) ending by time T (which can be set to T=+∞{\\displaystyle T=+\\infty } for no time horizon) the value at time t, V(t;T){\\displaystyle V(t;T)} is given by combining the values of these individual cash flows:\nThis formalizes time value of money to future values of cash flows with varying discount rates, and is the basis of many formulas in financial mathematics, such as the Black–Scholes formula with varying interest rates.\n", "Related_Entities": ["5.1Examples", "ArticleTalk", "Money portal", "astrarium", "quantum", "Timeline", "Father Time", "Kalachakra"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses the concept of the time value of money, emphasizing that receiving money sooner is more beneficial due to investment opportunities.

{"Entity": "Price–earnings_ratio", "Content": "\nThe price–earnings ratio, also known as P/E ratio, P/E, or PER, is the ratio of a company's share (stock) price to the company's earnings per share. The ratio is used for valuing companies and to find out whether they are overvalued or undervalued.\nAs an example, if share A is trading at $24 and the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period is $3, then share A has a P/E ratio of ⁠$24/$3/year⁠ = 8 years. Put another way, the purchaser of the share is investing $8 for every dollar of annual earnings; or, if earnings stayed constant it would take 8 years to recoup the share price. Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as \"not applicable\" or \"N/A\"); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown. There is a general consensus among most investors that a P/E ratio of around 20 is 'fairly valued'.\nThere are multiple versions of the P/E ratio, depending on whether earnings are projected or realized, and the type of earnings.\nSome people mistakenly use the formula ⁠market capitalization/ net income⁠ to calculate the P/E ratio. This formula often gives the same answer as ⁠market price/ earnings per share⁠, but if new capital has been issued it gives the wrong answer, as market capitalization = (market price) × (current number of shares), whereas earnings per share = ⁠net income/ weighted average number of shares⁠.\nVariations on the standard trailing and forward P/E ratios are common. Generally, alternative P/E measures substitute different measures of earnings, such as rolling averages over longer periods of time (to attempt to \"smooth\" volatile or cyclical earnings, for example),[2] or \"corrected\" earnings figures that exclude certain extraordinary events or one-off gains or losses. The definitions may not be standardized. For companies that are loss-making, or whose earnings are expected to change dramatically, a \"primary\" P/E can be used instead, based on the earnings projections made for the next years to which a discount calculation is applied.\nAs the ratio of a stock (share price) to a flow (earnings per share), the P/E ratio has the units of time. It can be interpreted as the amount of time over which the company would need to sustain its current earnings in order to make enough money to pay back the current share price.[3] While the P/E ratio can in principle be given in terms of any time unit, in practice it is essentially always implicitly reported in years, with the unit of \"years\" rarely indicated explicitly. (This is the convention followed in this article.)[dubious – discuss]\nThe price/earnings ratio (PER) is the most widely used method for determining whether shares are \"correctly\" valued in relation to one another. But the PER does not in itself indicate whether the share is a bargain. The PER depends on the market's perception of the risk and future growth in earnings. A company with a low PER indicates that the market perceives it as higher risk or lower growth or both as compared to a company with a higher PER. The PER of a listed company's share is the result of the collective perception of the market as to how risky the company is and what its earnings growth prospects are in relation to that of other companies. Investors use the PER to compare their own perception of the risk and growth of a company against the market's collective perception of the risk and growth as reflected in the current PER. If investors believe that their perception is superior to that of the market, they can make the decision to buy or sell accordingly.[4]\nSince 1900, the average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 index has ranged from 4.78 in Dec 1920 to 44.20 in Dec 1999.[5] However, except for some brief periods, during 1920–1990 the market P/E ratio was mostly between 10 and 20.[6]\nThe average P/E of the market varies in relation with, among other factors, expected growth of earnings, expected stability of earnings, expected inflation, and yields of competing investments. For example, when U.S. treasury bonds yield high returns, investors pay less for a given earnings per share and P/E's fall.[citation needed]\nThe average U.S. equity P/E ratio from 1900 to 2005 is 14 (or 16, depending on whether the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean, respectively, is used to average).[citation needed]\nJeremy Siegel has suggested that the average P/E ratio of about 15 [7] (or earnings yield of about 6.6%) arises due to the long-term returns for stocks of about 6.8%. In Stocks for the Long Run, (2002 edition) he had argued that with favorable developments like the lower capital gains tax rates and transaction costs, P/E ratio in \"low twenties\" is sustainable, despite being higher than the historic average.\nSet out below are the recent year end values of the S&P 500 index and the associated P/E as reported.[8] For a list of recent contractions (recessions) and expansions see U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.\nNote that at the height of the Dot-com bubble P/E had risen to 32. The collapse in earnings caused P/E to rise to 46.50 in 2001. It has declined to a more sustainable region of 17. Its decline in recent years has been due to higher earnings growth.\nDue to the collapse in earnings and rapid stock market recovery following the 2020 Coronavirus Crash, the trailing P/E ratio reached 38.3 on October 12, 2020. This elevated level was only attained twice in history, 2001-2002 and 2008-2009.[9]\nThe P/E ratio of a company is a major focus for many managers. They are usually paid in company stock or options on their company's stock (a form of payment that is supposed to align the interests of management with the interests of other stock holders). The stock price can increase in one of two ways: either through improved earnings or through an improved multiple that the market assigns to those earnings. In turn, the primary drivers for multiples such as the P/E ratio is through higher and more sustained earnings growth rates.\nConsequently, managers have strong incentives to boost earnings per share, even in the short term, and/or improve long-term growth rates. This can influence business decisions in several ways:\nIn general, a high price–earning ratio indicates that investors are expecting higher growth of company's earnings in the future compared to companies with a lower price–earning ratio.[10] A low price–earning ratio may indicate either that a company may currently be undervalued or that the company is doing exceptionally well relative to its past trends. The price-to-earnings ratio can also be seen as a means of standardizing the value of one dollar of earnings throughout the stock market. In theory, by taking the median of P/E ratios over a period of several years, one could formulate something of a standardized P/E ratio, which could then be seen as a benchmark and used to indicate whether or not a stock is worth buying. In private equity, the extrapolation of past performance is driven by stale investments. State and local governments that are more fiscally stressed by higher unfunded pension liabilities assume higher portfolio returns through higher inflation assumptions, but this factor does not attenuate the extrapolative effects of past returns.[11]\nWhen a company has no earnings or is posting losses, in both cases P/E will be expressed as \"N/A.\" Though it is possible to calculate a negative P/E, this is not the common convention.\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article explains the Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E ratio) as a critical measure for valuing companies to determine if they are overvalued or undervalued.

Different versions exist based on projected or realized earnings.

{"Entity": "Earnings_per_share", "Content": "Earnings per share (EPS) is the monetary value of earnings per outstanding share of common stock for a company. It is a key measure of corporate profitability and is commonly used to price stocks.[1]\nIn the United States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires EPS information for the four major categories of the income statement: continuing operations, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and net income.\nPreferred stock rights have precedence over common stock. Therefore, dividends on preferred shares are subtracted before calculating the EPS. When preferred shares are cumulative (i.e. dividends accumulate as payable if unpaid in the given accounting year), annual dividends are deducted whether or not they have been declared. Dividends in arrears are not relevant when calculating EPS.\nDiluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) is a company's earnings per share calculated using fully diluted shares outstanding (i.e. including the impact of stock option grants and convertible bonds). Diluted EPS indicates a \"worst case\" scenario, one that reflects the issuance of stock for all outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities that would reduce earnings per share.[2]\nCalculations of diluted EPS vary. Morningstar reports diluted EPS \"Earnings/Share $\", which is net income minus preferred stock dividends divided by the weighted average of common stock shares outstanding over the past year; this is adjusted for dilutive shares.[3][4] Some data sources may simplify this calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a reporting period.[5] The methods of simplifying EPS calculations and eliminating inappropriate assumptions include replacing primary EPS with basic EPS, eliminating the treasury stock method of accounting from fully diluted EPS, eliminating the three-percent test for dual presentation, and providing information on individual dilative securities.[6]\nCalculations of diluted EPS under U.S. GAAP are described under Statement No. 128 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FAS No. 128).[7] The objective of diluted EPS is to measure the performance of a company over the reporting period taking into account the dilutive effect of potential common stock that could be issued by the company.  To compute diluted EPS, both the denominator (outstanding shares) and the numerator (earnings) may need to be adjusted.\nDiluted shares: To calculate the total number of shares used in the calculation, FASB prescribes using the treasury method to calculate the dilutive effect of any instruments that could result in the issuance of shares, including:\nEarnings: The numerator used in calculating diluted EPS is adjusted to take into account the impact that the conversion of any securities would have on earnings.  For example, interest would be added back[8] to earnings to reflect the conversion of any outstanding convertible bonds, preferred dividends would be added back to reflect the conversion of convertible preferred stock, and any impact of these changes on other financial items, such as royalties and taxes, would also be adjusted.\nAs mentioned above, a helpful way to consider the effect of dilutive instruments on EPS is to think about the \"as if\" method; in the sense that \"if the instrument is converted, how does it affect EPS?\" For example, let Campany XYZ have Net Income = $2,000,000, there are 50,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and $1,000,000 of 10% bonds, convertible into 50,000 shares of common stock. Company A's tax rate is 25%.Basic EPS = ($2,000,000 - ($1,000,000*10%))/50,000 = $38 Diluted EPS = ($2,000,000 + (25%*($1,000,000*10%))) / 50,000 + 50,000 = $20.25Note that other than accounting for the shares of common stock added in the denominator of the EPS equation, we also add back the taxes that would have been taken out from Net income if the bonds were not converted. In conclusion, the \"as if\" method is helpful in considering the effect on dilutive instruments on EPS because it helps us think about the overall effect rather than just thinking about the numerator and denominator of the equation separately.\nUnder International Financial Reporting Standards, diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the earnings and number of shares for the effects of dilutive options and other dilutive potential common stock.[9] Dilutive potential common stock includes:[9]\nThe earnings per share requirements of U.S. GAAP, FASB ASC 260: EPS, are a result of the FASB's cooperation with the IASB to narrow the difference between IFRS and US GAAP. A few differences remain.\nThe differences that remain are the result of differences in the application of the treasury stock method, the treatment of contracts that may be settled in shares or cash, and contingently issuable shares.\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Germany"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses Earnings per Share (EPS), a vital metric for measuring corporate profitability and stock pricing.

{"Entity": "Market_capitalization", "Content": "\nMarket capitalization, sometimes referred to as market cap, is the total value of a publicly traded company's outstanding common shares owned by stockholders.[2]\nMarket capitalization is equal to the market price per common share multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding.[3][4][5]\nMarket capitalization is sometimes used to rank the size of companies. It measures only the equity component of a company's capital structure, and does not reflect management's decision as to how much debt (or leverage) is used to finance the firm. A more comprehensive measure of a firm's size is enterprise value (EV), which gives effect to outstanding debt, preferred stock, and other factors. For insurance firms, a value called the embedded value (EV) has been used.\nIt is also used in ranking the relative size of stock exchanges, being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange. The total capitalization of stock markets or economic regions may be compared with other economic indicators (e.g. the Buffett indicator). The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in 2020 was approximately US$93 trillion.[6]\nTotal market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world from 1975 to 2020.[6]\nMarket cap is given by the formula MC=N×P{\\textstyle {\\text{MC}}=N\\times P}, where MC is the market capitalization, N is the number of common shares outstanding, and P is the market price per common share.[7]\nFor example, if a company has 4 million common shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20, its market capitalization is then $80 million. If the closing price per share rises to $21, the market cap becomes $84 million. If it drops to $19 per share, the market cap falls to $76 million. This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price, average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs.\nNot all of the outstanding shares trade on the open market.  The number of shares trading on the open market is called the float.  It is equal to or less than N because N includes shares that are restricted from trading.  The free-float market cap uses just the floating number of shares in the calculation, generally resulting in a smaller number.\nTraditionally, companies were divided into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.[8][4] The terms mega-cap and micro-cap have since come into common use,[9][10] and nano-cap is sometimes heard. Large caps have a slow growth rate as compared to small caps. [2] Different numbers are used by different indexes;[11] there is no official definition of, or full consensus agreement about, the exact cutoff values. The cutoffs may be defined as percentiles rather than in nominal dollars. The definitions expressed in nominal dollars need to be adjusted over decades due to inflation, population change, and overall market valuation (for example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950, but it is not very large now), and market caps are likely to be different country to country.\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Scalper"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "Market capitalization, or market cap, is the total value of a publicly traded company's outstanding common shares. It is calculated by multiplying the market price per common share by the number of shares outstanding. Market cap is used to rank company sizes, but for a more comprehensive view, enterprise value (EV) is considered. EV factors in debt, preferred stock, and other elements. Market cap also ranks stock exchange sizes and can be compared with economic indicators. The formula for market cap is MC=N×P, where MC is market cap, N is the number of common shares outstanding, and P is the market price per common share. Different size categories like large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap exist in the market."}
{"Entity": "Valuation_(finance)", "Content": "In finance, valuation is the process of determining the value of a (potential) investment, asset, or security. Generally, there are three approaches taken, namely discounted cashflow valuation, relative valuation, and contingent claim valuation.[1]\nValuations can be done for assets (for example, investments in marketable securities such as companies' shares and related rights, business enterprises, or intangible assets such as patents, data and trademarks) or for liabilities (e.g., bonds issued by a company). Valuation is a subjective exercise, and in fact, the process of valuation itself can also affect the value of the asset in question.\nValuations may be needed for various reasons such as investment analysis, capital budgeting, merger and acquisition transactions, financial reporting, taxable events to determine the proper tax liability.In a business valuation context, various techniques are used to determine the (hypothetical) price that a third party would pay for a given company;while in a portfolio management context, stock valuation is used by analysts to determine the price at which the stock is fairly valued relative to its projected and historical earnings, and to thus profit from related price movement.\nCommon terms for the value of an asset or liability are market value, fair value, and intrinsic value. The meanings of these terms differ. For instance, when an analyst believes a stock's intrinsic value is greater (or less) than its market price, an analyst makes a \"buy\" (or \"sell\") recommendation. Moreover, an asset's intrinsic value may be subject to personal opinion and vary among analysts. The International Valuation Standards include definitions for common bases of value and generally accepted practice procedures for valuing assets of all types. Regardless, the valuation itself is done generally using one or more of the following approaches;[2] but see also, Outline of finance § Valuation:\nIn finance, valuation analysis is required for many reasons including tax assessment, wills and estates, divorce settlements, business analysis, and basic bookkeeping and accounting. Since the value of things fluctuates over time, valuations are as of a specific date like the end of the accounting quarter or year. They may alternatively be mark-to-market estimates of the current value of assets or liabilities as of this minute or this day for the purposes of managing portfolios and associated financial risk (for example, within large financial firms including investment banks and stockbrokers).\nSome balance sheet items are much easier to value than others. Publicly traded stocks and bonds have prices that are quoted frequently and readily available. Other assets are harder to value. For instance, private firms that have no frequently quoted price. Additionally, financial instruments that have prices that are partly dependent on theoretical models of one kind or another are difficult to value and this generates valuation risk. For example, options are generally valued using the Black–Scholes model while the liabilities of life assurance firms are valued using the theory of present value. Intangible business assets, like goodwill and intellectual property, are open to a wide range of value interpretations. Another intangible asset, data, is increasingly being recognized as a valuable asset in the information economy.[3]\nIt is possible and conventional for financial professionals to make their own estimates of the valuations of assets or liabilities that they are interested in. Their calculations are of various kinds including analyses of companies that focus on price-to-book, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash-flow and present value calculations, and analyses of bonds that focus on credit ratings, assessments of default risk, risk premia, and levels of real interest rates. All of these approaches may be thought of as creating estimates of value that compete for credibility with the prevailing share or bond prices, where applicable, and may or may not result in buying or selling by market participants. Where the valuation is for the purpose of a merger or acquisition the respective businesses make available further detailed financial information, usually on the completion of a non-disclosure agreement.\nValuation requires judgment and assumptions:\nUsers of valuations benefit when key information, assumptions, and limitations are disclosed to them. Then they can weigh the degree of reliability of the result and make their decision.\nBusinesses or fractional interests in businesses may be valued for various purposes such as mergers and acquisitions, sale of securities, and taxable events. When correct, a valuation should reflect the capacity of the business to match a certain market demand, as it is the only true predictor of future cash flows. An accurate valuation of privately owned companies largely depends on the reliability of the firm's historic financial information. Public company financial statements are audited by Certified Public Accountants (USA), Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) or Chartered Accountants (UK), and Chartered Professional Accountants (Canada) and overseen by a government regulator. Alternatively, private firms do not have government oversight—unless operating in a regulated industry—and are usually not required to have their financial statements audited. Moreover, managers of private firms often prepare their financial statements to minimize profits and, therefore, taxes. Alternatively, managers of public firms tend to want higher profits to increase their stock price. Therefore, a firm's historic financial information may not be accurate and can lead to over- and undervaluation. In an acquisition, a buyer often performs due diligence to verify the seller's information.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) show many assets based on their historic costs rather than at their current market values. For instance, a firm's balance sheet will usually show the value of land it owns at what the firm paid for it rather than at its current market value. But under GAAP requirements, a firm must show the fair values (which usually approximates market value) of some types of assets such as financial instruments that are held for sale rather than at their original cost. When a firm is required to show some of its assets at fair value, some call this process \"mark-to-market\". But reporting asset values on financial statements at fair values gives managers ample opportunity to slant asset values upward to artificially increase profits and their stock prices. Managers may be motivated to alter earnings upward so they can earn bonuses. Despite the risk of manager bias, equity investors and creditors prefer to know the market values of a firm's assets—rather than their historical costs—because current values give them better information to make decisions.\nThere are commonly three pillars to valuing business entities: comparable company analyses, discounted cash flow analysis, and precedent transaction analysis. Business valuation credentials include the Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) offered by the CBV Institute, ASA and CEIV from the American Society of Appraisers, and the CVA by the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts.\nThis method estimates the value of an asset based on its expected future cash flows, which are discounted to the present (i.e., the present value). This concept of discounting future money is commonly known as the time value of money. For instance, an asset that matures and pays $1 in one year is worth less than $1 today. The size of the discount is based on an opportunity cost of capital and it is expressed as a percentage or discount rate.\nIn finance theory, the amount of the opportunity cost is based on a relation between the risk and return of some sort of investment. Classic economic theory maintains that people are rational and averse to risk. They, therefore, need an incentive to accept risk. The incentive in finance comes in the form of higher expected returns after buying a risky asset. In other words, the more risky the investment, the more return investors want from that investment. Using the same example as above, assume the first investment opportunity is a government bond that will pay interest of 5% per year and the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the government. Alternatively, the second investment opportunity is a bond issued by small company and that bond also pays annual interest of 5%. If given a choice between the two bonds, virtually all investors would buy the government bond rather than the small-firm bond because the first is less risky while paying the same interest rate as the riskier second bond. In this case, an investor has no incentive to buy the riskier second bond. Furthermore, in order to attract capital from investors, the small firm issuing the second bond must pay an interest rate higher than 5% that the government bond pays. Otherwise, no investor is likely to buy that bond and, therefore, the firm will be unable to raise capital. But by offering to pay an interest rate more than 5% the firm gives investors an incentive to buy a riskier bond.\nFor a valuation using the discounted cash flow method, one first estimates the future cash flows from the investment and then estimates a reasonable discount rate after considering the riskiness of those cash flows and interest rates in the capital markets. Next, one makes a calculation to compute the present value of the future cash flows.\nThis method determines the value of a firm by observing the prices of similar companies (called \"guideline companies\") that sold in the market. Those sales could be shares of stock or sales of entire firms. The observed prices serve as valuation benchmarks. From the prices, one calculates price multiples such as the price-to-earnings or price-to-book ratios—one or more of which used to value the firm. For example, the average price-to-earnings multiple of the guideline companies is applied to the subject firm's earnings to estimate its value.\nMany price multiples can be calculated. Most are based on a financial statement element such as a firm's earnings (price-to-earnings) or book value (price-to-book value) but multiples can be based on other factors such as price-per-subscriber.\nThe third-most common method of estimating the value of a company looks to the assets and liabilities of the business. At a minimum, a solvent company could shut down operations, sell off the assets, and pay the creditors. Any cash that would remain establishes a floor value for the company. This method is known as the net asset value or cost method. In general the discounted cash flows of a well-performing company exceed this floor value. Some companies, however, are worth more \"dead than alive\", like weakly performing companies that own many tangible assets. This method can also be used to value heterogeneous portfolios of investments, as well as nonprofits, for which discounted cash flow analysis is not relevant. The valuation premise normally used is that of an orderly liquidation of the assets, although some valuation scenarios (e.g., purchase price allocation) imply an \"in-use\" valuation such as depreciated replacement cost new. This method is most appropriate in situations where there are no significant intangible assets, or when a company is voluntarily liquidating its assets as a result of ceased operations.\nAn alternative approach to the net asset value method is the excess earnings method. (This method was first described in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service's  Appeals and Review Memorandum 34,[further explanation needed] and later refined by Revenue Ruling 68-609.) The excess earnings method has the appraiser identify the value of tangible assets, estimate an appropriate return on those tangible assets, and subtract that return from the total return for the business, leaving the \"excess\" return, which is presumed to come from the intangible assets. An appropriate capitalization rate is applied to the excess return, resulting in the value of those intangible assets. That value is added to the value of the tangible assets and any non-operating assets, and the total is the value estimate for the business as a whole. See Clean surplus accounting, Residual income valuation.\nThe approaches to valuation outlined above, are generic and will be modified for the unique positioning and characteristics[4]of the business in question.[5]In the below cases, however, more specific valuation-practices have developed[6] within the investment industry.To these, more than elsewhere, real options valuation may be applied;[7]see Business valuation § Option pricing approaches.\nInvestors in a suffering company, or in other \"distressed securities\", may intend (i) to restructure the business, with the valuation reflecting its potential thereafter, or (ii) to purchase the company - or its debt - at a discount,  as part of an Investment Strategy aimed at realizing a profit on recovery.\nPreliminary to the valuation, the financial statements are initially recast, to \"better reflect the firm's indebtedness, financing costs and recurring earnings\".[8] Here adjustments are made to working capital, deferred capital expenditures, cost of goods sold, non-recurring professional fees and costs, above- or below-market leases, excess salaries in the case of private companies, and certain non-operating income/expense items.[9]\nThe valuation is built on this base, with any of the standard market-, income-, or asset-based approaches employed.  Often these are used in combination, providing a \"triangulation\" or (weighted) average.Particularly in the second case above, the company may be valued using real options analysis, serving to complement (or sometimes replace) this standard value; see Business valuation § Option pricing approaches and Merton model.\nAs required, various adjustments are then made to this result, so as to reflect characteristics of the firm external to its profitability and cash flow. These adjustments consider any lack of marketability resulting in a discount, and re the stake in question, any control premium or lack of control discount.Balance sheet items external to the valuation, but due to the new owners, are similarly recognized; these include excess (or restricted) cash, and other non-operating assets and liabilities.\nStartup companies such as Uber, which was valued at $50 billion in early 2015, are assigned post-money valuations based on the price at which their most recent investor put money into the company. The price reflects what investors, for the most part venture capital firms, are willing to pay for a share of the firm. They are not listed on any stock market, nor is the valuation based on their assets or profits, but on their potential for success, growth, and eventually, possible profits.[10] Many startup companies use internal growth factors to show their potential growth which may attribute to their valuation. The professional investors who fund startups are experts, but hardly infallible, see Dot-com bubble.[11]Valuation using discounted cash flows discusses various considerations here.\nThe valuation of early-stage startups can be more nuanced due to their lack of established track records. One common approach is using comparative valuations, although this method can be less accurate given the uniqueness of each startup.[12] Some methods adjust the average pre-money valuation of pre-revenue startups based on various attributes within the same market.[13] Average pre-money valuations in a particular region or sector, obtained from recent market deals, can also serve as reference points.[14] During Series A funding rounds, the typical valuation for startups is reported to be between $10 million to $15 million[15]\nValuation models can be used to value intangible assets such as for patent valuation, but also in copyrights, software, trade secrets, and customer relationships.[16]As economies are becoming increasingly informational, it is recognized that there is a need for new methods to value data, another intangible asset.\nValuations here are often necessary both for financial reporting and intellectual property transactions.They are also inherent in securities analysis - listed and private - in cases where analysts must estimate the incremental contribution of patents (etc) to equity value; see next paragraph. Since few sales of benchmark intangible assets can ever be observed, one often values these sorts of assets using either a present value model, or by estimating the cost of recreating the asset in question. In some cases,[17][18]option-based techniques or decision trees may be applied.Regardless of the method, the process is often time-consuming and costly.If required, stock markets can give an indirect estimate of a corporation's intangible asset value: this can be reckoned as the difference between its market capitalisation and its book value (including only hard assets), i.e. effectively its goodwill; see also PVGO.\nAs regards listed equity, the above techniques are most often applied in the biotech-, life sciences- and pharmaceutical sectors[19][20][21][18](see List of largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies).These businesses are involved in research and development (R&D), and testing, that typically takes years to complete, and where the new product may ultimately not be approved[18] (see Contingent value rights).Industry specialists thus apply the above techniques  - and here especially rNPV -   to the pipeline of products under development, and, at the same time,[16] also estimate the impact on existing revenue streams due to expiring patents. For relative valuation,[19] a specialized ratio is R&D spend as a percentage of sales. Similar analysis may be applied to options on films re the valuation of film studios.\nIn mining, valuation is the process of determining the value or worth of a mining property - i.e. as distinct from a listed mining corporate.  Mining valuations are sometimes required for IPOs, fairness opinions, litigation, mergers and acquisitions, and shareholder-related matters. In valuing a mining project or mining property, fair market value is the standard of value to be used.In general,[22]this result will be a function of the property's \"reserve\" - the estimated size and grade of the deposit in question - and the complexity and costs of extracting this.[23][24]\nCIMVal generally applied by the Toronto Stock Exchange, is widely recognized as a \"standard\" for the valuation of mining projects. (CIMVal: Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral Properties[25])The Australasian equivalent is VALMIN; the Southern African is SAMVAL.These standards stress the use of the cost approach, market approach, and the income approach, depending on the stage of development of the mining property or project;  see [26] for further discussion and context.Real Options analysis[27][28] is sometimes [22][26][27] used when there is a need to evaluate the project under different scenarios from inception.\nAnalyzing listed mining corporates (and other resource companies) is also specialized,[23]as the valuation requires a good understanding of the company's overall assets, its operational business model as well as key market drivers,[29]and an understanding of that sector of the stock market.[23]Re the latter, a distinction is usually made based on size and financial capabilities; see Mining § Corporate classifications.\nThere are two main difficulties with  valuing  financial services  firms.[30][31][32][33]The first is that the cash flows to a financial service firm cannot be easily estimated, since capital expenditures, working capital and debt are not clearly defined:  \"debt for a financial service firm is more akin to raw material than to a source of capital; the notion of cost of capital and enterprise value may be meaningless as a consequence.\"[30](See related discussion re. the risk management of financial- vs non-financial firms.)The second is that these firms operate under a highly regulated environment, and valuation assumptions (and model outputs) must incorporate regulatory limits, at least as \"bounds\".[33]\nThe approach taken for a DCF valuation, is to then \"remove\" debt from the valuation, by discounting at the cost of equity either free cash flow to equity (net income less any reinvestment in regulatory capital) or excess return;[34] a dividend based valuation is often employed. This is in contrast to the more typical approach of discounting free cash flow to the Firm where EBITDA less capital expenditures and working capital is discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, which incorporates the cost of debt.\nFor a multiple based valuation, similarly, price to earnings is preferred to EV/EBITDA.Here, there are also industry-specific measures used to compare between investments and within sub-sectors; this, once normalized by market cap (or other appropriate result), and recognizing regulatory differences:\nMismarking in securities valuation takes place when the value that is assigned to securities does not reflect what the securities are actually worth, due to intentional fraudulent mispricing.[35][36][37]\nMismarking misleads investors and fund executives about how much the securities in a securities portfolio managed by a trader are worth (the securities' net asset value, or NAV), and thus misrepresents performance.[38][39][40]\nWhen a rogue trader engages in mismarking, it allows him to obtain a higher bonus from the financial firm for which he works, where his bonus is calculated by the performance of the securities portfolio that he is managing.[38][39]\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Reverse", "Reverse"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses the concept of valuation in finance, which involves determining the value of investments, assets, or securities.

{"Entity": "Dividend", "Content": "\nA dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders, after which the stock exchange decreases the price of the stock by the dividend to remove volatility. The market has no control over the stock price on open on the ex-dividend date, though more often than not it may open higher.[1] When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a portion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings). The current year profit as well as the retained earnings of previous years are available for distribution; a corporation is usually prohibited from paying a dividend out of its capital. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually by bank transfer) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or by share repurchase. In some cases, the distribution may be of assets.\nThe dividend received by a shareholder is income of the shareholder and may be subject to income tax (see dividend tax). The tax treatment of this income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The corporation does not receive a tax deduction for the dividends it pays.[2]\nA dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share, with shareholders receiving a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. Dividends can provide at least temporarily stable income and raise morale among shareholders, but are not guaranteed to continue. For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders. Retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends) are shown in the shareholders' equity section on the company's balance sheet – the same as its issued share capital. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may cancel a scheduled dividend, or declare an unscheduled dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from the regular dividends. (more usually a special dividend is paid at the same time as the regular dividend, but for a one-off higher amount). Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.\nThe usually fixed payments to holders of preference shares (or preferred stock in American English) are classed as dividends. The word dividend comes from the Latin word dividendum (\"thing to be divided\").[3]\nIn the financial history of the world, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was the first recorded (public) company ever to pay regular dividends.[4][5] The VOC paid annual dividends worth around 18 percent of the value of the shares for almost 200 years of existence (1602–1800).[6]\nIn common-law jurisdictions, courts have typically refused to intervene in companies' dividend policies, giving directors wide discretion as to the declaration or payment of dividends. The principle of non-interference was established in the Canadian case of Burland v Earle (1902), the British case of Bond v Barrow Haematite Steel Co (1902), and the Australian case of Miles v Sydney Meat-Preserving Co Ltd (1912). However in Sumiseki Materials Co Ltd v Wambo Coal Pty Ltd (2013) the Supreme Court of New South Wales broke with this precedent and recognised a shareholder's contractual right to a dividend.[7]\nCash dividends are the most common form of payment and are paid out in currency, usually via electronic funds transfer or a printed paper check. Such dividends are a form of investment income of the shareholder, usually treated as earned in the year they are paid (and not necessarily in the year a dividend was declared). For each share owned, a declared amount of money is distributed. Thus, if a person owns 100 shares and the cash dividend is 50 cents per share, the holder of the stock will be paid $50. Dividends paid are not classified as an expense, but rather a deduction of retained earnings. Dividends paid does not appear on an income statement, but does appear on the balance sheet.\nDifferent classes of stocks have different priorities when it comes to dividend payments. Preferred stocks have priority claims on a company's income. A company must pay dividends on its preferred shares before distributing income to common share shareholders.\nStock or scrip dividends are those paid out in the form of additional shares of the issuing corporation, or another corporation (such as its subsidiary corporation). They are usually issued in proportion to shares owned (for example, for every 100 shares of stock owned, a 5% stock dividend will yield 5 extra shares).\nNothing tangible will be gained if the stock is split because the total number of shares increases, lowering the price of each share, without changing the market capitalization, or total value, of the shares held. (See also Stock dilution.)\nStock dividend distributions do not affect the market capitalization of a company.[8][9] Stock dividends are not includable in the gross income of the shareholder for US income tax purposes. Because the shares are issued for proceeds equal to the pre-existing market price of the shares; there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable.[10][11]\nProperty dividends or dividends in specie (Latin for \"in kind\") are those paid out in the form of assets from the issuing corporation or another corporation, such as a subsidiary corporation. They are relatively rare and most frequently are securities of other companies owned by the issuer, however, they can take other forms, such as products and services.\nInterim dividends are dividend payments made before a company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) and final financial statements. This declared dividend usually accompanies the company's interim financial statements.\nOther dividends can be used in structured finance. Financial assets with known market value can be distributed as dividends; warrants are sometimes distributed in this way. For large companies with subsidiaries, dividends can take the form of shares in a subsidiary company. A common technique for \"spinning off\" a company from its parent is to distribute shares in the new company to the old company's shareholders. The new shares can then be traded independently.[citation needed]\nA dividend payout ratio characterizes how much of a company's earnings (or its cash flow) is paid out in the form of dividends.\nMost often, the payout ratio is calculated based on dividends per share and earnings per share:[12]\nA payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more in dividends for the year than it earned.\nSince earnings are an accountancy measure, they do not necessarily closely correspond to the actual cash flow of the company. Hence another way to determine the safety of a dividend is to replace earnings in the payout ratio by free cash flow. Free cash flow is the business's operating cash flow minus its capital expenditures. It's a measure of how much incoming cash is \"free\" to pay out to stockholders and/or to grow the business.\nA free cash flow payout ratio greater than 100% means the company paid out more cash in dividends for the year than the \"free\" cash it took in.\nA dividend that is declared must be approved by a company's board of directors before it is paid. For public companies in the US, four dates are relevant regarding dividends:[13] The position in the UK is very similar, except that the expression \"in-dividend date\" is not used.\nDeclaration date – the day the board of directors announces its intention to pay a dividend. On that day, a liability is created and the company records that liability on its books; it now owes the money to the shareholders.\nIn-dividend date – the last day, which is one trading day before the ex-dividend date, where shares are said to be cum dividend ('with [including] dividend'). That is, existing shareholders and anyone who buys the shares on this day will receive the dividend, and any shareholders who have sold the shares lose their right to the dividend. After this date the shares becomes ex dividend.\nEx-dividend date – the day on which shares bought and sold no longer come attached with the right to be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States and many European countries, it is typically one trading day before the record date. This is an important date for any company that has many shareholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend. Existing shareholders will receive the dividend even if they sell the shares on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the shares will not receive the dividend. It is relatively common for a share's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend being paid, which reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the payment of the dividend.\nBook closure date – when a company announces a dividend, it will also announce the date on which the company will temporarily close its books for share transfers, which is also usually the record date.\nRecord date – shareholders registered in the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend, while shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend. Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.\nPayment date – the day on which dividend cheques will actually be mailed to shareholders or the dividend amount credited to their bank account.\nThe dividend frequency is the number of dividend payments within a single business year.[14] The most usual dividend frequencies are yearly, semi-annually, quarterly and monthly. Some common dividend frequencies are quarterly in the US, semi-annually in Japan, UK and Australia and annually in Germany.\nSome companies have dividend reinvestment plans, or DRIPs, not to be confused with scrips. DRIPs allow shareholders to use dividends to systematically buy small amounts of stock, usually with no commission and sometimes at a slight discount. In some cases, the shareholder might not need to pay taxes on these re-invested dividends, but in most cases they do. Utilizing a DRIP is a powerful investment tool because it takes advantage of both dollar cost averaging and compounding. Dollar cost averaging is the principle of investing a set amount of capital at recurring intervals. In this case, if the dividend is paid quarterly, then every quarter you are investing a set amount (the number of shares you own multiplied by the dividend per share). By doing this, you buy more shares when the price is low and fewer when the price is high. Additionally, the fractional shares that are purchased then begin paying dividends, compounding your investment and increasing the number of shares and total dividend earned each time a dividend distribution is made.\nGovernments may adopt policies on dividend distribution for the protection of shareholders and the preservation of company viability, as well as treating dividends as a potential source of revenue.[15]\nMost countries impose a corporate tax on the profits made by a company. Many jurisdictions also impose a tax on dividends paid by a company to its shareholders (stockholders), but the tax treatment of a dividend income varies considerably between jurisdictions. The primary tax liability is that of the shareholder, although a tax obligation may also be imposed on the corporation in the form of a withholding tax. In some cases, the withholding tax may be the extent of the tax liability in relation to the dividend. A dividend tax is in addition to any tax imposed directly on the corporation on its profits.[16]\nA dividend paid by a company is not an expense of the company.\nAustralia and New Zealand have a dividend imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax paid by the company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 − company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders who are able to use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.\nIn India, a company declaring or distributing dividends is required to pay a Corporate Dividend Tax in addition to the tax levied on their income. The dividend received by the shareholders is then exempt in their hands. Dividend-paying firms in India fell from 24 percent in 2001 to almost 19 percent in 2009 before rising to 19 percent in 2010.[17] However, dividend income over and above ₹1,000,000 attracts 10 percent dividend tax in the hands of the shareholder with effect from April 2016.[18] Since the Budget 2020–2021, DDT has been abolished. Now, the Indian government taxes dividend income in the hands of investor according to income tax slab rates.\nThe United States and Canada impose a lower tax rate on dividend income than ordinary income, on the assertion that company profits had already been taxed as corporate tax. In the United States, shareholders of corporations face double taxation - taxes on both corporate profits and taxes on distribution of dividends.\nThe rules in Part 23 of the Companies Act 2006 (sections 829-853) govern the payment of dividends to shareholders. The Act refers in this section to \"distribution\", covering any kind of distribution of a company's assets to its members (with some exceptions), \"whether in cash or otherwise\". A company is only able to make a distribution out of its accumulated, realised profits, \"so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated, realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly made\".[19]\nThe United Kingdom government announced in 2018 that it was considering a review of the existing rules on dividend distribution following a consultation exercise on insolvency and corporate governance. The aim was to address concerns which had emerged where companies in financial distress were still able to distribute \"significant dividends\" to their shareholders.[15] A requirement has been proposed under which the largest companies would be required to publish a distribution policy statement covering dividend distribution.[20]\nThe law in England and Wales regarding dividend payment was clarified in 2018 by the England and Wales Court of Appeal in the case of Global Corporate Ltd v Hale [2018] EWCA Civ 2618. Certain payments made to a director/shareholder had been treated by the High Court as quantum meruit payments to Hale in his capacity as a company director but the Appeal Court reversed this judgment and treated the payments as dividends. At the time of payment they had been treated as \"dividends\" payable from an anticipated profit. The company subsequently went into liquidation; an attempt to recharacterise the payments as payments for services rendered was held to be unlawful.[21]\nAfter a stock goes ex-dividend (when a dividend has just been paid, so there is no anticipation of another imminent dividend payment), the stock price should drop.\nTo calculate the amount of the drop, the traditional method is to view the financial effects of the dividend from the perspective of the company. Since the company has paid say £x in dividends per share out of its cash account on the left hand side of the balance sheet, the equity account on the right side should decrease an equivalent amount. This means that a £x dividend should result in a £x drop in the share price.\nA more accurate method of calculating the fall in price is to look at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a shareholder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be ⁠£0.85/1 − Tcg⁠ = ⁠£0.85/1 − 0.35⁠ = ⁠£0.85/0.65⁠ = £1.31. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.31, because the tax rate on capital losses is higher than the dividend tax rate. However in many countries the stock market is dominated by institutions which pay no additional tax on dividends received (as opposed to tax on overall profits). If that is the case, then the share price should fall by the full amount of the dividend.\nFinally, security analysis that does not take dividends into account may mute the decline in share price, for example in the case of a price–earnings ratio target that does not back out cash; or amplify the decline when comparing different periods.\nThe effect of a dividend payment on share price is an important reason why it can sometimes be desirable to exercise an American option early.\nSome[who?] believe company profits are best re-invested in the company with actions such as research and development, capital investment or expansion. Proponents of this view (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas for the future of the company. A counter-argument to this position came from Peter Lynch of Fidelity investments, who declared: \"One strong argument in favor of companies that pay dividends is that companies that don’t pay dividends have a sorry history of blowing the money on a string of stupid diworseifications\";[22] using his self-created term for diversification that results in worse effects, not better. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that companies that pay dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.[23] Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote in Securities Analysis (1934): \"The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends to its owners. A successful company is one that can pay dividends regularly and presumably increase the rate as time goes on.\"[24]\nOther studies indicate that dividend-paying stocks tend to offer superior long-term performance relative to the overall market at least in developed economies,[25][26] relative to a stock index such as the S&P 500[27][28] or Dow Jones Industrial Average[29] or relative to stocks that do not pay dividends.[28][30] Several explanations have been proposed for this outperformance such as dividends being associated with value stocks which are themselves associated with long-term outperformance;[31] being more durable in crashes or bear markets;[32][33]  being associated with profitable companies exhibiting high levels of free cashflow; and being associated with mature, unfashionable companies that are overlooked by many investors and thus an effective contrarian strategy.[34][35] Assett managers at Tweedy, Browne[36] and Capital Group[37] have suggested dividends are an effective measure of a given company's overall financial status.\nShareholders in companies that pay little or no cash dividends can potentially reap the benefit of the company's profits when they sell their shareholding, or when a company is wound down and all assets liquidated and distributed amongst shareholders. However, data from professor Jeremy Siegel found stocks that do not pay dividends tend to have worse long-term performance, as a group, than the general stock market and also perform worse than dividend-paying stocks.[35]\nTaxation of dividends is often used as justification for retaining earnings, or for performing a stock buyback, in which the company buys back stock, thereby increasing the value of the stock left outstanding.\nWhen dividends are paid, individual shareholders in many countries suffer from double taxation of those dividends:\nIn many countries, the tax rate on dividend income is lower than for other forms of income to compensate for tax paid at the corporate level.\nA capital gain should not be confused with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is taxed at the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.\nCertain types of specialized investment companies (such as a REIT in the U.S.) allow the shareholder to partially or fully avoid double taxation of dividends.\nCooperative businesses may retain their earnings, or distribute part or all of them as dividends to their members. They distribute their dividends in proportion to their members' activity, instead of the value of members' shareholding. Therefore, co-op dividends are often treated as pre-tax expenses. In other words, local tax or accounting rules may treat a dividend as a form of customer rebate or a staff bonus to be deducted from turnover before profit (tax profit or operating profit) is calculated.\nConsumers' cooperatives allocate dividends according to their members' trade with the co-op. For example, a credit union will pay a dividend to represent interest on a saver's deposit. A retail co-op store chain may return a percentage of a member's purchases from the co-op, in the form of cash, store credit, or equity. This type of dividend is sometimes known as a patronage dividend or patronage refund, as well as being informally named divi or divvy.[38][39][40]\nProducer cooperatives, such as worker cooperatives, allocate dividends according to their members' contribution, such as the hours they worked or their salary.[41]\nIn real estate investment trusts and royalty trusts, the distributions paid often will be consistently greater than the company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase in the value of the company's assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a return of capital and the book value of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount. This may result in capital gains which may be taxed differently from dividends representing distribution of earnings.\nThe distribution of profits by other forms of mutual organization also varies from that of joint-stock companies, though may not take the form of a dividend.\nIn the case of mutual insurance, for example, in the United States, a distribution of profits to holders of participating life policies is called a dividend.These profits are generated by the investment returns of the insurer's general account, in which premiums are invested and from which claims are paid.[42] The participating dividend may be used to decrease premiums, or to increase the cash value of the policy.[43]Some life policies pay nonparticipating dividends.As a contrasting example, in the United Kingdom, the surrender value of a with-profits policy is increased by a bonus, which also serves the purpose of distributing profits.Life insurance dividends and bonuses, while typical of mutual insurance, are also paid by some joint stock insurers.\nInsurance dividend payments are not restricted to life policies. For example, general insurer State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company can distribute dividends to its vehicle insurance policyholders.[44]\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Scalper"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article explains the concept of dividends, which are distributions of profits made by a corporation to its shareholders.

It explains the tax implications of dividends in various countries and the impact of dividend policies on shareholders and company performance."}
{"Entity": "Dividend_yield", "Content": "The dividend yield or dividend–price ratio of a share is the dividend per share divided by the price per share.[1] It is also a company's total annual dividend payments divided by its market capitalization, assuming the number of shares is constant. It is often expressed as a percentage.\nDividend yield is used to calculate the dividend earning on investments.[citation needed]\nHistorically, a higher dividend yield has been considered to be desirable among many investors. A high dividend yield can be considered to be evidence that a stock is underpriced or that the company has fallen on hard times and future dividends will not be as high as previous ones.  Similarly a low dividend yield can be considered evidence that the stock is overpriced or that future dividends might be higher. Some investors may find a higher dividend yield attractive, for instance as an aid to marketing a fund to retail investors, or maybe because they cannot get their hands on the capital, which may be tied up in a trust arrangement. In contrast some investors may find a higher dividend yield unattractive, perhaps because it increases their tax bill.\nDividend yield fell out of favor somewhat during the 1990s because of an increasing emphasis on price appreciation over dividends as the main form of return on investments.\nThe importance of the dividend yield in determining investment strength is still a debated topic; most recently, Foye and Valentincic (2017) suggested that high dividend yield stocks tend to outperform.[2] The persistent historic low in the Dow Jones dividend yield during the early 21st century is considered by some investors as indicative that the market is still overvalued.[citation needed]\nThe dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is obtained from the annual dividends of all 30 companies in the average divided by their cumulative stock price, has also been considered to be an important indicator of the strength of the U.S. stock market. Historically, the Dow Jones dividend yield has fluctuated between 3.2% (during market highs, for example in 1929) and around 8.0% (during typical market lows). The highest ever Dow Jones dividend yield occurred in 1932 when it yielded over 15%, which was years after the famous stock market collapse of 1929, when it yielded only 3.1%.\nWith the decreased emphasis on dividends since the mid-1990s, the Dow Jones dividend yield has fallen well below its historical low-water mark of 3.2% and reached as low as 1.4% during the stock market peak of 2000.\nThe Dogs of the Dow is a popular investment strategy which invests in the ten highest dividend yield Dow stocks at the beginning of each calendar year.\nIn 1982 the dividend yield on the S&P 500 Index reached 6.7%. Over the following 16 years, the dividend yield declined to just a percentage value of 1.4% during 1998, because stock prices increased faster than dividend payments from earnings, and public company earnings increased more slowly than stock prices. During the 20th century, the highest growth rates for earnings and dividends over any 30-year period were 6.3% annually for dividends, and 7.8% for earnings.[3]\nThe current yield is the ratio of the annual dividend to the current market price, which will vary over time.\nTrailing dividend yield gives the dividend percentage paid over a prior period, typically one year. A trailing twelve month dividend yield, denoted as \"TTM\", includes all dividends paid during the past year in order to calculate the dividend yield. While a trailing dividend can be indicative of future dividends, it can be misleading as it does not account for dividend increases or cuts, nor does it account for a special dividend that may not occur again in the future.\nForward dividend yield is some estimation of the future yield of a stock. This may be an analyst's estimate, or just using the company's guidance. For example, if a company has announced a dividend increase, even though nothing has been paid, this may be assumed to be the payment for the next year. Similarly, if a company has said that it will suspend its dividend, the yield would be assumed to be zero.\nThe calculation is done by taking the first dividend payment and annualizing it and then divide that number by the current stock price.  In other words, if the first quarterly dividend were $0.04 and the current stock price were $10.00 the forward dividend yield would be 0.04×410=1.6%{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {0.04\\times 4}{10}}=1.6\\%}.\nThe trailing dividend yield is done in reverse by taking the last dividend annualized divided by the current stock price.\nYield is sometimes computed based on the amount paid for a stock.[4] For example, if stock X was bought for $20/share, it split 2:1 three times (resulting in 8 total shares), it is now trading for $50 ($400 for 8 shares), and it pays a dividend of $2/year, then the yield on cost is 80% (8 shares × $2/share = $16/yr paid over $20 invested -> 16/20 = 0.8). The yield with the current price is 4% ($2/yr over $50 share price -> 2/50 = 0.04).\nUnlike preferred stock, there is no stipulated dividend for common stock (\"ordinary shares\" in the UK). Instead, dividends paid to holders of common stock are set by management, usually in consonance with company earnings. There is no guarantee that future dividends will match past dividends or even be paid at all. The historic yield is calculated using the following formula:\nFor example, take a company which paid dividends totaling $1 per share last year and whose shares currently sell for $20. Its dividend yield would be calculated as follows:\nThe yield for the S&P 500 is reported this way. US newspaper and web listings of common stocks apply a somewhat different calculation: They report the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by 4, divided by the current price. Others try to estimate the next year's dividend and use it to derive a prospective dividend yield. Such a scheme is used for the calculation of the FTSE UK Dividend+ Index[1]. Estimates of future dividend yields are by definition uncertain.\nDividend payments on preferred stocks are set out in the prospectus. The name of the preferred share will typically include its nominal yield relative to the issue price: for example, a 6% preferred share. However, the dividend may under some circumstances be passed or reduced.\nThe yield to call figure for a callable preferred share is the effective current yield, assuming that the issuer will exercise the call contingency immediately on the call date. The yield to call is implicitly a current measure of a future value, accounting for the difference between the future call price versus the current market price. Since the current market price may be above or below the call price, the yield to call may be below or above the current yield.\nFor callable preferred stocks, the yield to worst is the lesser of the current yield and the yield to call. Yield to worst represents the minimum of the various yield measures, across the returns resulting from various contingent future events.  This amounts to the worst case outcome from the investor's position.\nPreferred issues that are not callable, or whose call date has already arrived, do not have a yield to call or yield to worst. The only present yield measure in such cases is the current yield.\nThe reciprocal of the dividend yield is the price/dividend ratio. The dividend yield is related to the earnings yield via:\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Scalper"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses the concept of dividend yield in investment, defined as the dividend per share divided by the price per share, or a company's total annual dividend payments divided by its market capitalization. A higher dividend yield historically indicates an undervalued stock or financial distress, while a lower yield suggests overvaluation or potential dividend increases. The importance of dividend yield in investment strength is debated, with some studies indicating that high dividend yield stocks tend to outperform. The article explores various types of dividend yield calculations, such as trailing, forward, and yield to call for preferred shares. Additionally, it mentions the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy and historical trends in dividend yields in the stock market."}
{"Entity": "Dividend_payout_ratio", "Content": "The dividend payout ratio is the fraction of net income a firm pays to its stockholders in dividends:\nThe part of earnings not paid to investors is left for investment to provide for future earnings growth. Investors seeking high current income and limited capital growth prefer companies with a high dividend payout ratio. However, investors seeking capital growth may prefer a lower payout ratio because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. High growth firms in early life generally have low or zero payout ratios. As they mature, they tend to return more of the earnings back to investors. The dividend payout ratio is calculated as DPS/EPS.\nAccording to Financial Accounting by Walter T. Harrison, the calculation for the payout ratio is as follows:\nThe dividend yield is given by earnings yield times the dividend payout ratio:\nConversely, the P/E ratio is the Price/Dividend ratio times the DPR.\nSome companies choose stock buybacks as an alternative to dividends; in such cases this ratio becomes less meaningful. One way to adapt it using an augmented payout ratio:[1]\nAugmented Payout Ratio = (Dividends + Buybacks)/ Net Income for the same period\nThe data for S&P 500 is taken from a 2006 Eaton Vance post.[2] The payout rate has gradually declined from 90% of operating earnings in 1940s to about 30% in recent years.\nFor smaller, growth companies, the average payout ratio can be as low as 10%.[3]\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article discusses the dividend payout ratio, which is the portion of a firm's net income paid to stockholders as dividends.

{"Entity": "Financial_ratio", "Content": "\nA financial ratio or accounting ratio states the relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios may be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies.[1] If shares in a company are publicly listed, the market price of the shares is used in certain financial ratios.\nRatios can be expressed as a decimal value, such as 0.10, or given as an equivalent percentage value, such as 10%. Some ratios are usually quoted as percentages, especially ratios that are usually or always less than 1, such as earnings yield, while others are usually quoted as decimal numbers, especially ratios that are usually more than 1, such as P/E ratio; these latter are also called multiples. Given any ratio, one can take its reciprocal; if the ratio was above 1, the reciprocal will be below 1, and conversely. The reciprocal expresses the same information, but may be more understandable: for instance, the earnings yield can be compared with bond yields, while the P/E ratio cannot be: for example, a P/E ratio of 20 corresponds to an earnings yield of 5%.\nValues used in calculating financial ratios are taken from the balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows or (sometimes) the statement of changes in equity. These comprise the firm's \"accounting statements\" or financial statements. The statements' data is based on the accounting method and accounting standards used by the organisation.\nFinancial ratios quantify many aspects of a business and are an integral part of the financial statement analysis. Financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business which the ratio measures. Liquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt.[2] Activity ratios measure how quickly a firm converts non-cash assets to cash assets.[3] Debt ratios measure the firm's ability to repay long-term debt.[4] Profitability ratios measure the firm's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return.[5] Market ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock.[6]These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\nFinancial ratios allow for comparisons\nRatios generally are not useful unless they are benchmarked against something else, like past performance or another company. Thus, the ratios of firms in different industries, which face different risks, capital requirements, and competition are usually hard to compare.\nFinancial ratios may not be directly comparable between companies that use different accounting methods or follow various standard accounting practices. Most public companies are required by law to use generally accepted accounting principles for their home countries, but private companies, partnerships and sole proprietorships may elect to not use accrual basis accounting. Large multi-national corporations may use International Financial Reporting Standards to produce their financial statements, or they may use the generally accepted accounting principles of their home country.\nThere is no international standard for calculating the summary data presented in all financial statements, and the terminology is not always consistent between companies, industries, countries and time periods.\nAn important of ration analysis is interpreting ratio values. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed to answer questions such as \"Is it too high or too low?\" or \"Is it good or bad?\". Two types of ratio comparisons can be made, cross-sectional and time-series.[7]\nCross-sectional analysis compares the financial ratios of different companies at the same point in time. It allows companies to benchmark from other competitors by comparing their ratio values to similar companies in the industry.\nTime-series analysis evaluates a company's performance over time. It compares its current performance against past or historical performance. This can help assess the company's progress by looking into developing trends or year-to-year changes.\nVarious abbreviations may be used in financial statements, especially financial statements summarized on the Internet. Sales reported by a firm are usually net sales, which deduct returns, allowances, and early payment discounts from the charge on an invoice. Net income is always the amount after taxes, depreciation, amortization, and interest, unless otherwise stated. Otherwise, the amount would be EBIT, or EBITDA (see below).\nCompanies that are primarily involved in providing services with labour do not generally report \"Sales\" based on hours. These companies tend to report \"revenue\" based on the monetary value of income that the services provide.\nNote that Shareholders' Equity and Owner's Equity are not the same thing, Shareholder's Equity represents the total number of shares in the company multiplied by each share's book value; Owner's Equity represents the total number of shares that an individual shareholder owns (usually the owner with controlling interest), multiplied by each share's book value. It is important to make this distinction when calculating ratios.\n(Note:  These are not ratios, but values in currency.)\nProfitability ratios measure the company's use of its assets and control of its expenses to generate an acceptable rate of return\nLiquidity ratios measure the availability of cash to pay debt.\nActivity ratios measure the effectiveness of the firm's use of resources.\nDebt ratios quantify the firm's ability to repay long-term debt. Debt ratios measure the level of borrowed funds used by the firm to finance its activities.\nMarket ratios measure investor response to owning a company's stock and also the cost of issuing stock.These are concerned with the return on investment for shareholders, and with the relationship between return and the value of an investment in company's shares.\nOther Market Ratios\nSector-specific ratios\nIn addition to assisting management and owners in diagnosing the financial health of their company, ratios can also help managers make decisions about investments or projects that the company is considering to take, such as acquisitions, or expansion.\nMany formal methods are used in capital budgeting, including the techniques such as\n", "Related_Entities": ["ArticleTalk", "Germany"], "Soure": "wiki", "Summary": "The article explains financial ratios, which are used to evaluate a company's financial health by comparing numerical values from its financial statements.

ROEs of 15–20% are generally considered good.[2]\nROE is also a factor in stock valuation, in association with other financial ratios.

It is the act of allocating resources, usually capital (i.e., money), with the expectation of generating an income, profit, or gains.One can invest in many types of endeavors (either directly or indirectly), such as using money to start a business or in assets such as real estate in hopes of generating rental income and/or reselling it later at a higher price.Investing also differs from speculation, as evidenced by the investor's timeframe. Speculators are typically looking to gain from short-term price fluctuations that occur in weeks, days, or even minutes. Investors usually consider that a greater period of time, like months or years, is needed to generate acceptable returns.Key TakeawaysInvesting involves deploying capital (money) toward projects or activities expected to generate a positive return over time.The type of returns generated depends on the type of project or asset; real estate can produce both rents and capital gains; many stocks pay quarterly dividends; bonds tend to pay regular interest.In investing, risk and return are two sides of the same coin; low risk generally means low expected returns, while higher returns are usually accompanied by higher risk.Investors can take the do-it-yourself approach or employ the services of a professional money manager.Whether buying a security qualifies as investing or speculation depends on four factors—the amount of risk taken, the holding period, the frequency of the investment activity, and the source of returns.Understanding InvestingInvesting is to grow one's money over time. The core premise of investing is the expectation of a positive return in the form of income or price appreciation withstatistical significance. The spectrum of assets in which one can invest and earn a return is vast.Risk and returngo hand-in-hand in investing; low risk generally means low expected returns, while higher returns are usually accompanied by higher risk. At the low-risk end of the spectrum are basic investments such as Certificates of Deposit (CDs); bonds or fixed-income instruments are higher up on the risk scale, while stocks or equities are regarded as riskier.Commodities and derivatives are generally considered to be among the riskiest investments. One can also invest in something practical, such as land, real estate, or delicate items, such as fine art and antiques.Risk and return expectations can vary widely within the same asset class. For example, ablue chipthat trades on the New York Stock Exchange will have a very different risk-return profile from amicro-capthat trades on a small exchange.The returns generated by an asset depend on its type. For instance, many stocks pay quarterly dividends, whereas bonds generally pay interest every quarter. In many jurisdictions,different types of income are taxed at different rates.In addition to regular income, such as a dividend or interest, price appreciation is an important component of return. Total return from an investment can thus be regarded as the sum of income and capital appreciation.Standard & Poor's estimates that from 1926 to 2023, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of total return for the S&P 500 while capital gains have contributed 68%.Capital gainsare, therefore, an important piece of investing.NoteEconomists view investing and saving to be two sides of the same coin. This is because when you save money by depositing in a bank, the bank then lends that money to individuals or companies that want to borrow that money to put it to good use. Therefore, your savings are often someone else's investment.Types of InvestmentsToday, investment is mostly associated with financial instruments that allow individuals or businesses to raise and deploy capital to firms. These firms then rake that capital and use it for growth or profit-generating activities.While the universe of investments is vast, here are the most commontypes of investments.StocksA buyer of a company's stock becomes a fractional owner of that company. Owners of a company's stock are known as its shareholders. They can participate in its growth and success through appreciation in the stock price and regular dividends paid out of the company's profits.BondsBonds are debt obligations of entities, such as governments, municipalities, and corporations. Buying a bond implies that you hold a share of an entity's debt and are entitled to receive periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value when it matures.FundsFunds are pooled instruments managed by investment managers that enable investors to invest in stocks, bonds, preferred shares, commodities, etc. Two of the most common types of funds aremutual fundsandexchange-traded funds(ETFs).Mutual funds do not trade on an exchange and are valued at the end of the trading day; ETFs trade on stock exchanges and, like stocks, are valued constantly throughout the trading day. Mutual funds and ETFs can either passively track indices, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or can be actively managed by fund managers.Investment TrustsTrusts are another type of pooled investment.Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)are one of the most popular in this category. REITs invest in commercial or residential properties and pay regular distributions to their investors from the rental income received from these properties. REITs trade on stock exchanges and thus offer their investors the advantage of instant liquidity.Alternative Investments\"Alternative investments\" is a catch-all category that includes hedge funds and private equity. Hedge funds are so-called because they can limit (hedge) their investment risks by going long andshorton stocks and other investments.Private equity enables companies to raise capital without going public. Hedge funds and private equity were typically only available to affluent investors deemed \"accredited investors\" who met certain income and net worth requirements. However, in recent years, alternative investments have been introduced in fund formats accessible to retail investors.Options and Other DerivativesDerivativesare financial instruments that derive value from another instrument, such as a stock or index. Options contracts are a popular derivative that gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a security at a fixed price within a specific period. Derivatives usually employleverage, making them a high-risk, high-reward proposition.CommoditiesCommoditiesinclude metals, oil, grain, animal products, financial instruments, and currencies. They can either be traded through commodity futures—agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a specified price on a particular future date—or ETFs. Commodities can be used for hedging risk or speculative purposes.Comparing Investing StylesLet's compare a couple of the most common investing styles:Active vs. passive investing:The goal of active investing is to \"beat the index\" by actively managing the investment portfolio.Passive investing, on the other hand, advocates a passive approach, such as buying an index fund, in tacit recognition of the fact that it is difficult to beat the market consistently. While there are pros and cons to both approaches, in reality, few fund managers beat their benchmarks consistently enough to justify the higher costs of active management.Growth vs. value:Growth investorsprefer to invest in companies in their growth stages, which typically have higher valuation ratios than value companies.Value investorslook for companies that are undervalued by the market that meet their more strict investing criteria.How to InvestDo-It-Yourself InvestingThe question of \"how to invest\" boils down to whether you are a do-it-yourself (DIY) kind of investor or would prefer to have your money managed by a professional. Many investors who prefer to manage their money themselves have accounts at discount or online brokerages because of their low commissions and the ease of executing trades on their platforms.DIY investing is sometimes called self-directed investing, and requires a fair amount of education, skill, time commitment, and the ability to control one's emotions. If these attributes do not describe you well, it may be smarter to let a professional help manage your investments.Professionally-Managed InvestingInvestors who prefer professional money management generally have wealth managers looking after their investments. Wealth managers usually charge their clients a percentage of assetsunder management (AUM)as their fees.While professional money management is more expensive than managing money by oneself, such investors don't mind paying for the convenience of delegating research, investment decision-making, andtradingto an expert.NoteThe SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy urges investors to confirm that their investment professional is licensed and registered.Robo-Advisor InvestingSome investors opt to invest based on suggestions from automated financial advisors. Powered by algorithms and artificial intelligence,robo-advisorsgather critical information about the investor and their risk profile to make suitable recommendations.With little to no human interference, robo-advisors offer a cost-effective way of investing with services similar to what a human investment advisor provides. With advancements in technology, robo-advisors are capable of more than selecting investments. They can also help people develop retirement plans and manage trusts and other retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s.A Brief History of InvestingWhile the concept of investing has been around for millennia, investing in its present form can find its roots in the period between the 17th and 18th centuries when the development of the first public markets connected investors with investment opportunities. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was established in 1602, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1792.Industrial Revolution InvestingThe First Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) and the Second (late 19th century and early 20th century) resulted in greater prosperity, as a result of which people amassed savings that could be invested, fostering the development of an advanced banking system. Most of the established banks that dominate the investing world began in the 1800s, including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.20th Century InvestingThe 20th century saw new ground being broken in investment theory, with the development of new concepts in asset pricing,portfolio theory, and risk management. In the second half of the 20th century, many new investment vehicles were introduced, including hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, REITs, and ETFs.In the 1990s, the rapid spread of the Internet made online trading and research capabilities accessible to the general public, completing the democratization of investing that had commenced more than a century ago.21st Century InvestingThe bursting of the dotcom bubble—a bubble that created a new generation of millionaires from investments in technology-driven and online business stocks—ushered in the 21st century and perhaps set the scene for what was to come.In 2001, the collapse of Enron took center stage, with its full display of fraud that bankrupted the company and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, as well as many of its investors.One of the most notable events in the 21st century, or history for that matter, is theGreat Recession(2007-2009) when an overwhelming number of failed investments in mortgage-backed securities crippled economies around the world. Well-known banks and investment firms went under, foreclosures surmounted, and the wealth gap widened.The 21st century also opened the investing world to newcomers and unconventional investors by saturating the market with discount online investment companies and free-trading apps, such as Robinhood.Investing vs. SpeculationThere is no clear definition separating investing from speculation used for legal or regulatory means. All forms of investment incur risk and include a speculative hope that the investment will pay off. Because the outcome is uncertain, there is little to distinguish between the two activities. However, some generalities do apply when attempting to categorize these activities:The amount of returns sought: Speculators often seek an extreme degree of return, where investors may be content with a less flashy payout.The holding period of the investment: Investing typically involves a longer holding period, measured quite frequently in months or years; speculation usually involves less than a few months, although some speculators are content to wait years for their bets to pay off.The frequency of investments: Investments can be initiated more frequently if the holding period is shorter. Speculators tend to have a higher frequency of investment decisions than investors when comparing within a common timeframe.Source of returns: Price fluctuation is the exclusive source of return for speculators. Investors may be able to gain income through dividends, coupons, or other interest payments, though they certainly hope to gain from price appreciation as well.Price volatility is often considered a common measure of risk, but a comparatively lower investment size can offset price volatility. So, although blue-chip, dividend-paying stocks may seem much less risky than small-cap growth stocks orcryptocurrencyinvestments, the risk may actually have more to do with the comparative risk taken on by the individual investor.Proper risk management has more to do with the position size of one's investment than the total investment capital. The amount of risk in an investing strategy is also influenced by the frequency with which an investor takes on risk in an individual investment. Speculators tend to have a higher frequency of initiating risk. Thus, speculation is considered more risky.Example of Return From InvestingAssume you purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock for $310 per share ($31,000) and sold it exactly a year later for $46,020. What was your approximate total return, ignoring commissions? Keep in mind, XYZ does not issue stock dividends. The resulting capital gain would be [ ( $46,020 - $31,000 ) / $31,000 ] x 100 = 48.5%.Now, imagine that XYZ had issued dividends during your holding period, and you received $5 in dividends per share. Your approximate total return would then be 50.06%:$46,020 + $500 = $46,520[ ( $46,520 - $31,000 ) / $31,000 ] x 100 = 50.06%How Can Investing Grow My Money?Investing is not reserved for the wealthy. You can invest nominal amounts. For example, you can purchase low-priced stocks, deposit small amounts into an interest-bearing savings account, or save until you accumulate a target investment amount.If your employer offers a retirement plan, such as a 401(k), allocate small amounts from your pay until you can increase your investment. If your employer participates in matching, you may realize that your investment has doubled.You can begin investing in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds or even open an IRA. Starting with $1,000 is nothing to sneeze at. A $1,000 investment in Amazon's IPO in 1997 would yield millions today.This was mainly due to several stock splits, but it does not change the result: monumental returns. Savings accounts are available at most financial institutions and don't usually require a large amount to invest. Savings accounts don't typically boast high interest rates, so shop around to find one with the best features and most competitive rates.Believe it or not, you can invest in real estate with $1,000. You may not be able to buy an income-producing property, but you can invest in a company that does. Areal estate investment trust (REIT)is a company that invests in and manages real estate to drive profits and produce income. With $1,000, you can invest in REIT stocks, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds.How Can I Start Investing?You can choose the do-it-yourself route, selecting investments based on your investing style, or enlist the help of an investment professional, such as an advisor or broker. Before investing, it's important to determine your preferences and risk tolerance. If you're risk-averse, choosing stocks and options may not be the best choice.Develop a strategy outlining how much to invest, how often to invest, and what to invest in based on goals and preferences. Before allocating your resources, research the target investment to make sure it aligns with your strategy and has the potential to deliver the desired results. Remember, you don't need a lot of money to begin, and you can modify as your needs change.What Are Some Types of Investments?There are many types of investments to choose from. Perhaps the most common are stocks, bonds, and ETFs/mutual funds. Other types of investments to consider are real estate, CDs, annuities, cryptocurrencies, commodities, collectibles, and precious metals.Is Investing the Same As Gambling?Investing and gambling are similar in one aspect: the variability of chance. However, these activities differ in how they are designed, approached, and regulated. Gambling is confined to what can happen within a given event. In some cases, the game's rules are dictated by a person or entity that offers the game, and the rules can be constructed to benefit them over time.Investing differs from gambling because the regulators—government and industry entities—only regulate the markets. As such, their incentive is to create a fair and orderly playing field rather than to try and profit.The Bottom LineInvesting is the act of distributing resources into something to generate income or gain profits. The type of investment you choose might likely depend on what you seek to gain and how sensitive you are to risk.Assuming little risk generally yields lower returns, and assuming high risk typically yields higher returns. Investments can be made in stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, and more. You can invest with money, assets, cryptocurrency, or other mediums of exchange.There are different types of investment vehicles, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate, each carrying different levels of risks and rewards.Investors can independently invest without the help of an investment professional or enlist the services of a licensed and registered investment advisor. Technology has also afforded investors the option of receiving automated investment solutions by way of robo-advisors.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Units of stock are calledshares, which entitle the owner to a proportion of the corporation’sassetsand profits equal to how much stock they own.Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges and are the foundation of many individual investors’portfolios. Stock trades have to conform to government regulations meant to protectinvestorsfrom fraudulent practices.Key TakeawaysA stock is a form of security that indicates the holder has proportionate ownership in the issuing corporation and is sold predominantly on stock exchanges.Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses.There are two main types of stock: common and preferred.Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run.Understanding StocksCorporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock, a shareholder, may have a claim to part of the company’s assets and earnings.Ashareholderis considered an owner of the issuing company, determined by the number of shares an investor owns relative to the number ofoutstanding shares. If a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person owns 100 shares, that person would own and have a claim to 10% of the company’sassetsandearnings.Stockholders do notowna corporation, but corporations are a special type of organization because the law treats them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes, can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that a corporation is a “person” means that the corporationowns its assets. A corporate office full of chairs and tables belongs to the corporation, andnotto the shareholders.Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits theliabilityof both the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets sold, but a shareholder’s assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the value of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the company’s assets to pay theircreditors.ShareholderA person, company, or institution that owns at least one share of a company’sstockWhat Is Shareholder Ownership?What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation owns the assets held by a firm. If you own 33% of the shares of a company, it is incorrect to assert that you own one-third of that company. However, you do own one-third of the company’s shares. This is known as “separation of ownership and control.”Owning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receivedividendsif and when they are distributed, and the right to sell your shares to somebody else.If you own a majority of shares, your voting power increases so that you can indirectly control the direction of a company by appointing its board of directors.This becomes most apparent when one company buys another. The acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares.The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation and often does so by hiring professional managers, or officers, such as thechief executive officer (CEO). Ordinary shareholders do not manage the company.The importance of being a shareholder is that you are entitled to a portion of the company’s profits, which is the foundation of a stock’s value. The more shares you own, the larger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, however, do not pay out dividends and instead reinvest profits back into growing the company. Theseretained earnings, however, are still reflected in the value of a stock.Read about Investopedia’s10 Rules of Investingby picking up a copy of our special-issue print edition.How to Compare Common and Preferred StockThere are two main types of stock:common and preferred.Common stockusually entitles the owner to vote at shareholders’ meetings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation.Preferred stockholdersgenerally do not havevoting rights, though they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders. For example, owners of preferred stock receive dividends beforecommon shareholdersand have priority if a company goes bankrupt and is liquidated.The first common stock ever issued was by the Dutch East India Company in 1602.Companies can issue new shares whenever there is a need to raise additional cash. This process dilutes the ownership and rights of existing shareholders (provided that they do not buy any of the new offerings). Corporations can also engage in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders because they cause their shares toappreciatein value.What Is the Difference Between Stocks and Bonds?Stocks are issued by companies to raisecapitalto grow the business or undertake new projects. There are important distinctions between whether somebody buys shares directly from the company when it issues them in theprimary marketor from another shareholder in thesecondary market. When the corporation issues shares, it does so in return for money.Bondsvary from stocks in several ways. Bondholders are creditors to the corporation and are entitled to interest as well as repayment of the principal invested. Also, creditors are given legal priority over other stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first if a company isforced to sell assets.Conversely, shareholders often receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy, implying that stocks are inherently riskier investments than bonds.How Do You Buy Stock?Most often, stocks are bought and sold onstock exchanges, such as the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). After a company goes public through an initial public offering (IPO), its stock becomes available for investors to buy and sell on an exchange.Typically, investors will use a brokerage account to purchase stock on the exchange, which will list the purchasing price (the bid) or the selling price (the offer). The price of the stock is influenced by supply and demand factors in the market, among other variables.How Can You Earn Income from Owning Stock?There are two ways to earn money by owning shares of stock: through dividends and capital appreciation.Dividends are cash distributions of company profits. If a company has 1,000 shares outstanding and declares a $5,000 dividend, then stockholders will get $5 for each share they own.Capital appreciation is the increase in the share price itself. If you sell a share to someone for $10, and the stock is later worth $11, the shareholder has made $1.Is It Risky to Own Stock?All investments have a degree ofrisk. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can lose value if market conditions decline.When you invest, you make choices about what to do with your financial assets. Your investment value might rise or fall because of market conditions or corporate decisions, such as whether to expand into a new area of business or merge with another company.Historically, stocks have outperformed most other investments over the long run.The Bottom LineA stock representsfractional ownership of equityin an organization. It is different from a bond, which operates like a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments.A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new projects or to expand its business operations.The type of stock, common or preferred, held by a shareholder determines the rights and benefits of ownership.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when theprincipalof the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms forvariableorfixed interestpayments made by the borrower.Key TakeawaysA bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate or coupon to debtholders.Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice-versa.Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default.Investopedia / Ellen LindnerHow Bonds WorkBonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure.Corporations often borrow togrow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees.Bonds are fixed-income securities and are one of the mainasset classesfor individual investors, along withequitiesand cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and thematurity datethe bond principal must be paid back. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer.The interest rate that determines the payment is called thecoupon rate.The initial price of most bonds is typically setat paror $1,000face valueper individual bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on thecredit qualityof the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.Markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or tobuy bondsfrom other individuals—long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bondthrough to its maturity date.Characteristics of BondsFace value or Par Value: The value of the bond at maturity and the reference amount the bond issuer uses when calculating interest payments.Coupon Rate:The rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.Coupon Dates:The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments.Maturity Date:The date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.Issue Price:The price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds. In many cases, bonds are issuedat par.Bond CategoriesThere are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also seeforeign bondsissued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.Corporate Bonds: Companies issuecorporate bondsrather than seek bank loans for debt financing because bond markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.Municipal Bonds:Issued by states and municipalities. Somemunicipal bondsoffer tax-free coupon income for investors.Government Bonds:Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called “Bills,” bonds issued with one–10 years to maturity are called “notes,” andgovernment bondsissued with more than 10 years to maturity are called “bonds.” The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as \"treasuries.\"Agency Bonds: Issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are consideredagency bonds.Bond Prices and Interest RatesA bond's price changes daily wheresupply and demanddetermine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond tomaturitythey will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bond’s price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.The issuer of afixed-rate bondpromises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year.If prevailing market interest rates are also 10% at the time that this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return $100. However, if interest rates drop to 5%, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from the corporate bond.Investors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment—in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%.Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case to a price of $666.67.Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)Theyield-to-maturity (YTM)is the totalreturnanticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered along-termbond yieldbut is expressed as anannualrate.YTM is theinternal rate of returnof an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled.YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate.YTM.InvestopediaInvestors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates.This practical definition is themodified durationof a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.How To Invest in BondsWhile there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and TIPS are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via itsTreasuryDirectwebsite. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds thatinvest in a portfolio of bonds. Investors can also take a look at Investopedia's list of thebest online stock brokers.Image by Sabrina Jiang Â© Investopedia 2020Bond VariationsThe bonds available for investors come in many different varieties, depending on the rate or type of interest or coupon payment, by being recalled by the issuer, or because they have other attributes.Zero-Coupon Bonds (Z-bonds):Do not pay coupon payments and instead are issued at a discount to their par value that will generate a return once the bondholder is paid the full face value when the bond matures. U.S. Treasury bills arezero-coupon bonds.Convertible Bonds: Debt instruments with an embedded option that allows bondholders toconverttheir debt into stock (equity) at some point, depending on certain conditions like the share price.Callable Bonds: Have an embedded option, but it is different than what is found in a convertible bond. Acallable bondcan be “called” back by the company before it matures. A callable bond is riskier for the bond buyer because the bond is more likely to be called when it is rising in value.Puttable Bonds: allows the bondholders to put or sell the bond back to the company before it has matured.This is valuable for investors who are worried that a bond may fall in value or if they think interest rates will rise and they want to get their principal back before the bond falls in value. Aputtable bondusually trades at a higher value than a bond without a put option but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate because it is more valuable to the bondholders.What Determines a Bond's Coupon Rate?Two features of a bond—credit quality and time to maturity—are the principal determinants of a bond's coupon rate. If the issuer has a poorcredit rating, theriskofdefaultis greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed tointerest rateand inflation risks for an extended period.How Are Bond's Rated?Credit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies likeStandard and Poor’s,Moody’s, andFitch Ratings. The very highest quality bonds are called “investment grade” and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as many utilities.Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called “high yield” or “junk” bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk.What Is Duration?Bonds and bond portfolios will rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called “duration.” The use of the term duration in this contextcan be confusing to new bond investorsbecause it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bond’s price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates.The Bottom LineBonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Market ReturnUnderstanding Taxes on Mutual Funds DividendsCloseWhat Is a Mutual Fund?A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities (according to the fund's stated strategy).It allows individual investors to gain exposure to a professionally-managed portfolio and potentially benefit from economies of scale, while spreading risk across multiple investments.Key TakeawaysA mutual fund is a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities purchased with the pooled capital of investors.Mutual funds give individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios.Mutual funds are known by the kinds of securities they invest in, their investment objectives, and the type of returns they seek.Mutual funds charge annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, which lower their overall returns.Many American workers put their retirement funds into mutual funds through employer-sponsored retirement plans, a form of \"automatic investing\" that builds wealth over the long-term with more limited investment risk than other asset choices.Investopedia / Ellen LindnerMutual Funds: How Many is Too Many?How Mutual Funds WorkMutual funds are defined as a portfolio of investments funded by all the investors who have purchased shares in the fund. So, when an individual buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all the underlying assets the fund owns. The fund's performance depends on how its collective assets are doing. When these assets increase in value, so does the value of the fund's shares. Conversely, when the assets decrease in value, so does the value of the shares.The mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the strategy of the fund. About half of the mutual funds held by American households are in index equity funds, which have portfolios that comprise and weigh the assets of indexes to mirror the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).Thelargest mutual fundsare managed byVanguard and Fidelity. They are also index funds. These generally have limited investment risk, unless the entirety of the market goes down. Nevertheless, over the long run, index funds tied to the market have gone up, helping to meet the investment objectives of many future retirees.By 2023, over half of American households had investments in mutual funds, collectively owning 88% of all mutual fund assets. This marks a significant increase from just a few decades ago, when, in 1980, less than 6% of U.S. households were invested in mutual funds. Today, much of the retirement savings of middle-income Americans are tied up in these funds.When setting aside money in mutual funds, households can access a broad range of investments, which can help cut their risk compared to investing in a single stock or bond. Investors earn returns based on the fund's performance minus any fees or expenses charged. Mutual funds are often the investment of choice for middle America, providing a broad swath of middle-income workers with professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other asset classes.Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies orfund familiessuch as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer.How Are Earnings Calculated for Mutual Funds?Investors typically earn returns from a mutual fund in three ways:Dividend/interest income:Mutual funds distribute thedividendson stocks and interest on bonds held in its portfolio. Funds often give investors the choice of either receiving a check for distributions or reinvesting earnings for additional shares in the mutual fund.Portfolio distributions: If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund realizes acapital gain, which most funds also pass on to investors in a distribution.Capital gains distribution: When the fund's shares increase in price, you can sell your mutual fund shares for a profit in the market.When researching the returns of a mutual fund, you'll typically come upon a figure for the \"total return,\" or the net change in value (either up or down) over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund has generated along with the change in its market value during a given period. In most cases, total returns are given for one, five, and 10-year periods, as well as from the day the fund opened or inception date.Types of Mutual FundsThere are many types among the more than 8,700 mutual funds in the U.S., with most in four main categories: stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds.Stock FundsAs the name implies, this fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: firms with small-, mid-, or large-sized capitalization. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity style box like the example below.Value fundsinvest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks' true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high P/E ratios and do not pay dividends.A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a \"blend.\" These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle.Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2019Large-cap companies havemarket capitalizationsof over $10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between $250 million and $2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap.A mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall; these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above (small and growth).Bond FundsA mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of thefixed-incomecategory. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments. The bonds should generate interest income that's passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk.There are alsoactively managedfunds seeking relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but aren't without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities.Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on when and when they invest, and all bond funds are subject to risks related to changes in interest rates.Index Mutual FundsIndex mutual fundsare designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500 or the DJIA. Thispassive strategyrequires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.They also frequently outperform actively managed mutual funds and thus potentially are the rare combination in life of less cost and better performance.Balanced FundsBalanced funds invest across different securities, whether stocks, bonds, themoney market, or alternative investments. The objective of these funds, known as an asset-allocation fund, is to cut risk through diversification.Mutual funds detail their allocation strategies, so you know ahead of time what assets you're indirectly investing in. Some funds follow a strategy for dynamic allocation percentages to meet diverse investor objectives. This may include responding to market conditions, business cycle changes, or the changing phases of the investor's own life.Theportfolio manageris commonly given the freedom toswitch the ratio of asset classesas needed to maintain the fund's stated strategy.Money Market Mutual FundsThe money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. The returns on them aren't substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit (CD). Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or for an emergency fund. While low risk, they aren't insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) like savings accounts or CDs.Income FundsIncome fundsare meant to disburse income on a steady basis, and are often seen as the mutual funds for retirement investing. They invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may rise in value, the primarygoal is to offer a steady cash flow​.International Mutual FundsAninternational mutual fund, or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investor's home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere worldwide. Their volatility depends on where and when the funds are invested. However, these funds can be part of a well-balanced,diversifiedportfolio since the returns from abroad may provide a ballast against lower returns at home.Regional Mutual FundsOften international in scope,regional mutual fundsare investment vehicles that focus on a specific geographic region, such as a country, a continent, or a group of countries with similar economic characteristics. These funds invest in stocks, bonds, or other securities of companies that are headquartered, or generate a significant part of their revenue, within a targeted region.Examples of regional mutual funds include Europe-focused mutual funds that invest in that continent's securities; emerging market mutual funds, which focus on investments in developing economies worldwide; and Latin America-focused mutual funds that invest in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina.The main advantage of regional mutual funds is that they allow investors to capitalize on the growth potential of specific geographic areas and diversify their portfolios internationally. However, these funds also carry unique risks, such as political instability, currency fluctuations, and economic uncertainties, though they depend on the region.Sector and Theme Mutual FundsSector mutual fundsaim to profit from the performance of specific sectors of the economy, such as finance, technology, or health care. Theme funds can cut across sectors. For example, a fund focused on AI might have holdings in firms in health care, defense, and other areas employing and building out AI beyond the tech industry. Sector or theme funds can have volatility from low to extreme, and their drawback is that in many sectors, stocks tend to rise and fall together.Socially Responsible Mutual FundsSocially responsible investing(SRI) or so-called ethical funds invest only in companies and sectors that meet preset criteria. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in industries like tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Sustainable mutual funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling.There are also funds that reviewenvironmental, social, and governance(ESG) factors when choosing investments. This approach focuses on the company's management practices and whether they tend toward environmental and community improvement.How to Invest in Mutual FundsInvesting in mutual funds is relatively straightforward and involves the following steps:Before buying shares, you should check with your employer if they offer additional mutual fund products since these might come with matching funds or are more beneficial tax-wise.Ensure you have a brokerage account with enough deposits andaccess to buy mutual fund shares.Identify mutual funds matching your investing goals for risk, returns, fees, and minimum investments. Many platforms offer fund screening and research tools.Determine how much you want to invest and submit your trade. If you choose, you can likely set up automatic recurring investments as desired.While these investments are most often for the long term, you should still check on how the fund is doing periodically, making adjustments as needed.When it's time to close your position, enter a sell order on your platform.Mutual Fund FeesWhen investing in mutual funds, it's essential tounderstand the fees associated with them, as these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees:Expense ratio: This is an annual fee that covers the fund's operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses. Theexpense ratiois expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets and is deducted from the fund's returns. Pressured by competition from index investing andexchange-traded funds(ETFs), mutual funds have lowered the expense ratio by more than half over the last 30 years. In 1996, equity mutual fund investors incurred expense ratios of 1.04% ($1.04 for every $100 in assets). By 2022, that average had fallen to 0.44%, according to the Investment Company Institute. The fees for bond mutual funds were slightly less at 0.37%, and hybrid models, which often require more management, had expense fees averaging 0.59%.Sales charges or loads: Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known as \"loads,\" when you buy or sell shares. Front-end loads are charged when you buy shares, while back-end loads (or contingent and deferred sales charges) are assessed if you sell your shares before a certain date. Sometimes, however, management firms offerno-load mutual funds, which don't have commission or sales charges.Redemption fees: Some mutual funds charge aredemption feewhen you sell shares within a short period (usually 30 to 180 days) after purchasing them, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) limits to 2%.This fee is designed to discourage short-term trading in these funds for stability.Other account fees: Some funds or brokerage firms may charge extra fees for maintaining your account or transactions, especially if your balance falls below a certain minimum.While many mutual funds are \"no-load,\" you can frequently avoid brokerage fees and commissions anyway by purchasing a fund directly from the mutual fund company instead of going through an intermediary.Classes of Mutual Fund SharesIf you're trying to cut your fees, you'll want to watch the type of mutual fund shares you buy. Traditionally, individual investors would buy mutual funds withA-sharesthrough a broker. Then, a front-end load of up to 5% or more, plus management fees and ongoing fees for distributions (also known as 12b-1 fees), would be tacked on. Financial advisors selling these products may encourage clients to buy higher-load offerings to generate commissions. With front-end funds, the investor pays for these expenses as they buy into the fund.To remedy these problems and meet fiduciary-rule standards, investment companies have designated new share classes, including \"level load\" C shares, which generally don't have a front-end load but carry a 12b-1 annual distribution fee of up to 1%.Funds that charge management and other fees when investors sell their holdings are classified as Class B shares.How Mutual Fund Shares Are PricedThe value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities it invests in. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, you get a part of its portfolio value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund differs from investing in stock shares. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders voting rights. And unlike ETFs, you can't trade your shares throughout the trading day.Mutual fund share prices come from the net asset value (NAV) per share, sometimes listed on platforms asNAVPS. A fund's NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the number of shares outstanding.Mutual fund shares are typically bought or redeemed at the fund's NAV, which doesn't fluctuate during market hours but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled.Pros and Cons of Mutual Fund InvestingThere are many reasons that mutual funds have been theretail investor's vehicle of choice, with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds. The SEC, in particular, has long paid very close attention to how these funds are run, given their importance to so many Americans and their retirements.Mutual Fund Pros & ConsProsLiquidityDiversificationMinimal investment requirementsProfessional managementVariety of offeringsConsHigh fees, commissions, and other expensesLarge cash presence in portfoliosNo FDIC coverageDifficulty in comparing fundsLack of transparency in holdingsPros of Mutual Fund InvestingDiversificationDiversification, or the mixing of investments and assets within a portfolio to reduce risk, is one of the advantages of investing in mutual funds. A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. A mutual fund can achieve diversification faster and more cheaply than buying individual securities.Easy AccessTrading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, for certain types of assets, like foreign equities orexotic commodities, mutual funds are often the most workable way—sometimes the only way—for individual investors to participate.Economies of ScaleMutual funds also provideeconomies of scale. Buying only one security at a time could lead to hefty transaction fees. Mutual funds also enable investors to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging, which is putting away a set amount periodically, no matter the changes in the market.Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could.Professional ManagementA professionalinvestment manageruses research and skillful trading. A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management.TransparencyMutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms.You can research and choose from funds with different management styles and goals. A fund manager may focus on value investing,growth investing, developed markets, emerging markets, income, or macroeconomic investing, among many other styles. This variety enables investors to gain exposure not only to stocks and bonds but also to commodities, foreign assets, and real estate through specialized mutual funds. Mutual funds provide prospects for foreign and domestic investment that might otherwise be inaccessible.Mutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the fund's stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.Cons of Mutual Fund InvestingLiquidity, diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks:No FDIC GuaranteeLike many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund willdepreciate. Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the fund's portfolio. The FDIC does not guarantee mutual fund investments.Cash DragMutual funds require a significant part of their portfolios to be held in cash to satisfy share redemptions each day. To maintainliquidityand the ability to accommodate withdrawals, mutual funds typically have to keep a larger percentage of their portfolio as cash than other investors. Because this cash earns no return, it's called a \"cash drag.\"Higher CostsFees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed whatever the performance of the fund. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year.DilutionDilutionis also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use.The SEC requires that funds have at least 80% of assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title.How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80% of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging. Some less scrupulous fund managers might manipulate prospective investors via their fund titles. For example, a fund that focuses narrowly on Argentine stocks could be sold with a much-more-ranging title like \"International High-Tech Fund.\"End-of-Day Trading OnlyA mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time. However, unlike stocks and ETFs that trade throughout the day, mutual fundredemptionscan only take place at the end of the trading day.TaxesWhen the mutual fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered, which can be extended to you. ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a401(k)orIRA.Evaluating Mutual FundsResearching and comparing fundscan be more difficult than for other securities. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price to earnings (P/E) ratio, sales growth,earnings per share(EPS), or other important data. A mutual fund's NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable.Watch Out for \"Diworsification\"\"Diworsification\"—a play on words that defines the concept—is an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to over-complicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification.Example of a Mutual FundAmong the most notable mutual funds is Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund (FMAGX). Established in 1963, the fund had an investment objective of capital appreciation via investment in common stocks. The fund's height of success was between 1977 and 1990 when Peter Lynch served as its portfolio manager. Under Lynch's tenure, Magellan's assets under management increased from $18 million to $14 billion.As of March 2024, Fidelity Magellan has about $33 billion in assets, managed by Sammy Simnegar since 2019. The S&P 500 is the fund's primary benchmark.Mutual Funds vs. Index FundsIndex fundsare mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an S&P 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely.By contrast,actively managedmutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research.Index funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs, time horizons, and risk appetite.Index vs. Active Mutual FundsAttributeIndex FundsActive FundsGoalMatch a market indexOutperform the marketManagement StylePassive, automatedActive by fund managersFeesLow expense ratiosHigher expense ratiosPerformanceAverage market returnsAttempt to beat averagesMutual Funds vs. ETFsMutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. ​However, there are some crucial differences.Among the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks.Another significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiums/discounts to NAV than mutual funds.Compared with mutual funds, ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient.Are Mutual Funds Safe Investments?All investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds—and the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and manager's competence. Unlike deposits at banks and credit unions, the money invested in mutual funds isn't FDIC or otherwise insured.Can I Withdraw Money From a Mutual Fund Anytime?Yes. Mutual funds are generally highly liquid investments, meaning you can redeem your shares on any business day. However, it's important to be aware of any potential fees or penalties associated with early withdrawals, such asredemption feesor short-term trading fees, which some funds impose to discourage people from trading in and out of the funds frequently.Withdrawing funds may have tax implications, particularly if the investment has appreciated in value, which means you'll have to pay taxes on the capital gains.Do You Actually Make Money in Mutual Funds?Yes, many make money for retirement and other savings goals through capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income.As securities in the mutual fund's portfolio increase in value, the value of the fund's shares typically rises, leading to capital gains. In addition, many mutual funds pay out dividends from the income the fund has earned by the securities they hold. If the fund holds bonds, then it will earn interest on them.However, returns are not guaranteed, and the performance of a mutual fund depends on market conditions, the fund's management, what assets it holds, and its investment strategy.What Are the Risks of Mutual Funds?Depending on the assets they hold, mutual funds carry several investment risks, including market, interest rate, andmanagement risk. Market risk arises from the potential decline in the value of the securities within the fund. Interest rate risk affects funds holding bonds and other fixed-income securities, as rising interest rates can lead to a decrease in bond prices.Management risk is linked to the performance of the fund's management team. You are putting your money in their hands, and poor investment decisions will negatively impact your returns. Before investing, it's important for investors to carefully review the fund's prospectus and consider their own risk tolerance and investment objectives.What Is a Target Date Mutual Fund?When investing in a 401(k) or other retirement savings account,target-date or life cycle fundsare popular. Choosing a fund that builds toward your retirement, like a hypothetical FUND X 2050 (which would target a 2050 retirement year), means investing in a mutual fund that rebalances and automatically shifts its risk profile to a more conservative approach as the target date gets closer.The Bottom LineMutual funds are versatile and accessible for those looking to diversify their portfolios. These funds pool money from investors for stocks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, and other securities—all managed for you. Key benefits include access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios and choosing among funds tailored to different objectives and risk tolerances. However, mutual funds come with fees and expenses, including annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, that will help determine your overall returns.Investors can choose from many types of mutual funds, such as stock, bond, money market, index, and target-date funds, each with its investment focus and strategy. The returns on mutual funds come from distributions of income from dividends or interest and selling fund securities at a profit.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

ETFs can be structured to track anything from the price of a commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities.ETFs can even be designed to track specific investment strategies. Various types of ETFs are available to investors for income generation, speculation, and price increases, and to hedge or partly offset risk in an investor’sportfolio. The first ETF was the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks theS&P 500 Index.Key TakeawaysAn exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock does.ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds, which only trade once a day after the market closes.ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually.Investopedia / Zoe HansenHow ETFs WorkAn ETF must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the United States, most ETFs are set up asopen-ended fundsand are subject to theInvestment Company Actof 1940, except where subsequent rules have modified their regulatory requirements.Open-end funds do not limit the number of investors involved in the product.Vanguard's Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index and has a minimum investment of $1.00. The fund holds shares of all 104 companies on the index, some familiar to most because they produce or sell consumer items. A few of the companies held by VDC are Proctor & Gamble, Costco, Coca-Cola, Walmart, and PepsiCo.Investors who buy $1.00 in VDC own $1.00 shares representing 104 companies.There is no transfer of ownership because investors buy a share of the fund, which owns the shares of the underlying companies. Unlike mutual funds, ETF share prices are determined throughout the day. A mutual fund trades only once a day after market close.Volatile stock performance is curtailed in an ETF because they do not involve direct ownership of securities. Industry ETFs are also used to rotate in and out of sectors duringeconomic cycles.Cash Invested in ETFs by YearTypes of ETFsPassive ETF:PassiveETFs aim to replicate the performance of a broader index—either a diversified index such as the S&P 500 or a more specific targeted sector or trend.Actively managed ETF:Do not target an index of securities, but rather have portfolio managers making decisions about which securities to include in the portfolio.Actively managedETFs have benefits over passive ETFs but can be more expensive to investors.Bond ETF:Used to provide regular income to investors and distribution depends on the performance of underlying bonds which may include government, corporate, and state and local bonds, usually calledmunicipal bonds. Unlike their underlying instruments,bondETFsdo not have a maturity date.Stock ETF:A basket of stocks that track a single industry or sector like automotive orforeign stocks. The aim is to provide diversified exposure to a single industry, one that includes high performers and new entrants with growth potential. Unlike stock mutual funds,stock ETFshave lower fees and do not involve actual ownership of securities.Industry orsector ETF:Funds that focus on a specific sector or industry. An energy sector ETF will include companies operating in that sector. Blackrock's iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) mirrors the performance of the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index and holds 1374 stocks of technology sector companies.Commodity ETF:Invest incommoditieslike crude oil or gold.Commodity ETFscan diversify a portfolio, making it easier to hedge market downturns. Holding shares in a commodity ETF is cheaper than physical possession of the commodity.Currency ETF:Track the performance of currency pairs consisting of domestic and foreign currencies.Currency ETFscan be used to speculate on the prices ofcurrenciesbased on political and economic developments in a country. They are also used to diversify a portfolio or as a hedge againstvolatilityin forex markets by importers and exporters.Bitcoin ETF:Thespot Bitcoin ETFwas approved by theSEC in 2024. These ETFs expose investors to bitcoin's price moves in their regular brokerage accounts by purchasing and holding bitcoins as the underlying asset and allowing them to buy shares of the fund.Bitcoin futures ETFs, approved in 2021, use futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and mimic the price movements of bitcoin futures contracts.Ethereum ETF:Spot ether ETFsprovide a way to invest inether, the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain, without directly owning the cryptocurrency. In May 2024, the SEC permitted Nasdaq, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the NYSE to list ETFs holding ether. And inJuly 2024, the SEC officially approved nine spot ether ETFs to begin trading on U.S. exchanges.Inverse ETF:Earn gains from stock declines byshorting stocks. Shorting is borrowing a stock, selling it while expecting a decline in value, and repurchasing it at a lower price. An inverse ETF usesderivativesto short a stock. Inverse ETFs areexchange-traded notes(ETNs) and not true ETFs. An ETN is a bond that trades like a stock and is backed by an issuer such as a bank.Leveraged ETF:Aleveraged ETFseeks to return some multiples (e.g., 2× or 3×) on the return of the underlying investments. If the S&P 500 rises 1%, a 2× leveraged S&P 500 ETF will return 2% (and if the index falls by 1%, the ETF would lose 2%). These products use debt and derivatives, such as options or futures contracts, to leverage their returns.As of January 2024, nine ETFs focus on companies engaged in gold mining, excluding inverse, leveraged, and funds with low assets under management (AUM).Pros and Cons of ETFsProsAccess to many stocks across various industriesLow expense ratios and fewer broker commissionsRisk management through diversificationETFs exist that focus on targeted industriesConsActively managed ETFs have higher feesSingle-industry-focused ETFs limit diversificationLack of liquidity hinders transactionsHow to Invest in ETFsETFs trade throughonline brokersand traditionalbroker-dealers. Many sources providepre-screened brokersin the ETF industry. Individuals can also purchase ETFs in their retirement accounts. An alternative to standard brokers is arobo-advisorlikeBettermentandWealthfront.An ETF’sexpense ratiois the cost to operate and manage the fund. ETFs typically have low expenses because they track an index.ETFs are available on most online investing platforms, retirement account provider sites, and investing apps like Robinhood. Most of these platforms offer commission-free trading, meaning that investors don’t have to pay fees to the platform providers to buy or sell ETFs.After creating and funding a brokerage account, investors can search for ETFs and make their chosen buys and sells. One of the best ways to narrow ETF options is to utilize an ETF screening tool with criteria such as trading volume, expense ratio, past performance, holdings, and commission costs.TipOrder a copy of Investopedia'sWhat To Do With $10,000for more wealth-building advice.Most Popular ETFs for InvestorsBelow are examples of popular ETFs on the market.Some ETFs track an index of stocks, thus creating a broad portfolio, while others target specific industries.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY): The oldest surviving and most widely known ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index.iShares Russell 2000 (IWM): An ETF that tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index.Invesco QQQ(QQQ) (“cubes”): An ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, which typically contains technology stocks.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) (“diamonds”): An ETF that represents the 30 stocks of theDow Jones Industrial Average.Sector ETFs: ETFs that track individual industries and sectors such as oil (OIH), energy (XLE), financial services (XLF), real estateinvestment trusts(IYR), and biotechnology (BBH).Commodity ETFs: These ETFs represent commodity markets, including gold (GLD),silver(SLV), crude oil (USO), and natural gas (UNG).Country ETFs: Funds that track the primary stock indexes in foreign countries, but they are traded in the United States and denominated in U.S. dollars. Examples include China (MCHI), Brazil (EWZ), Japan (EWJ), and Israel (EIS). Others track a wide breadth of foreign markets, such as ones that track emerging market economies (EEM) and developed market economies (EFA).ETFs vs. Mutual Funds vs. StocksMost stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs differ from stocks because of the management fees that most of them carry, though they have been trending lower for many years. In general, ETFs tend to have lower average fees than mutual funds.Exchange-Traded FundsMutual FundsStocksExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of index funds that track a basket of securities.Mutual funds are pooled investments into bonds, securities, and other instruments.Stocks are securities that provide returns based on performance.ETF prices can trade at a premium or at a loss to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund.Mutual fund prices trade at the net asset value of the overall fund.Stock returns are based on their actual performance in the markets.ETFs are traded in the markets during regular hours, just like stocks are.Mutual funds can be redeemed only at the end of a trading day.Stocks are traded during regular market hours.Some ETFs can be purchased commission-free and are cheaper than mutual funds because they do not charge marketing fees.Some mutual funds do not charge load fees, but most are more expensive than ETFs because they charge administrative and marketing fees.Stocks can be purchased commission-free on some platforms and generally do not have charges associated with them after purchase.ETFs do not involve actual ownership of securities.Mutual funds own the securities in their basket.Stocks involve physical ownership of the security.ETFs diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments.Mutual funds diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments.Risk is concentrated in a stock’s performance.ETF trading generally occurs in-kind, meaning they are not redeemed for cash.Mutual fund shares can be redeemed for money at the fund’s net asset value for that day.Stocks are bought and sold using cash.Because ETF share exchanges are usually treated as in-kind distributions, ETFs are the most tax-efficient among all three types of financial instruments.Mutual funds offer tax benefits when they return capital or include certain types of tax-exempt bonds in their portfolio.Stocks are taxed at either ordinary income tax rates or capital gains rates.Active vs. Passive Equity FundsDividends and TaxesThough ETFs allow investors to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of the profits, such as earnedinterestordividendspaid, and may get a residual value if the fund isliquidated.An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor does not need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy.Redeeming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability, so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund.Creation and RedemptionThe supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors calledauthorized participants (APs). When an ETF wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index—such as the S&P 500 tracked by the fund—and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit.When an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called acreation unit. If an ETF closes with a share price of $101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth $100 on a per-share basis, then the fund’s price of $101 was traded at a premium to the fund’snet asset value(NAV). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF.Conversely, an AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process calledredemption. The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund’s assets.ETFs in the United KingdomThe U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe, with ETFs listed on theLondon Stock Exchange (LSE)that offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments.BuyingETFs in the U.K.allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow investors to invest up to £20,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns.Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K.U.K. investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but due to local and European regulations, you're not allowed to purchase U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.K.There are U.K.-based ETFs that track U.S. markets, as long as it has the 'UCITS' moniker in the name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments.For broad-based exposure to U.K. equities, there are several UCITS ETFs that track theFTSE 100index,  which consists of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07% and a dividend yield of 3.62% as of January 2024.What Was the First Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)?The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) is often given to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993.There were, however, some precursors to the SPY, notably securities called Index Participation Units listed on theToronto Stock Exchange (TSX)that tracked the Toronto 35 Index that appeared in 1990.How Is an ETF Different From an Index Fund?An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index, tracking it. However, thedifference between an index fund and an ETFis that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF from a broker who will execute the trade throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker only at the close of each trading day.Do ETFs Provide Diversity?Nearly all ETFs provide diversification benefits relative to an individual stock purchase. Still, some ETFs are highly concentrated—either in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund that concentrates half of its assets in two or three positions may offer less diversification than a fund with fewer total portfolio constituents but broader asset distribution.The Bottom LineExchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holdsone, many, or only ETFs. Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there are some additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

The process can begin any time during your working years, but the earlier the better.The process of creating a retirement plan includes identifying your income sources, adding up your expenses, putting a savings plan into effect, and managing your assets. By estimating your future cash flows, you can judge whether your retirement income goal is realistic.Needless to say, a retirement plan is not a static document. You'll need to update it from time to time as well as review it to monitor your progress.Key TakeawaysIt is never too early or too late to start a retirement plan.A retirement plan is a strategy for long-term saving, investing, and finally withdrawing money you accumulate to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.A key part of a retirement plan is taking advantage of one of the government-approved investment vehicles, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k) account, which offer tax advantages to retirement savers.Your retirement plan needs to take into account your estimated future expenses, liabilities, and life expectancy.What Is a Retirement Plan?A retirement plan may be seen as a roadmap to a comfortable life after work. It entails accumulating enough money to pay for the lifestyle you want to enjoy in the future. Your retirement plan may well change over time, but the earlier you get started the better.8 Essential Tips For Retirement SavingHow Retirement Planning WorksA retirement plan is your preparation for a good life after you're done working to pay the bills, or at least done working a full-time job. But it's not all about money.The non-financial aspects include lifestyle choices such as how you want to spend your time in retirement and where you'll live. A holistic approach to retirement planning considers all these areas.The goals for your retirement plan will change in focus over time:Early in a person’s working life, your contribution to retirement savings may be modest. The reward is 40-plus years of investment growth.During the middle of your career, when your income may be at its peak, you might set specific income or asset targets and take steps toward achieving them.Once you reach retirement age, you go from accumulating assets to what planners call the distribution phase. You’re no longer paying into your retirement account(s). Instead, you start collecting the rewards of decades of savings.Some retirement plans change depending on where you are. The United States andCanadaeach have unique systems of workplace-sponsored plans.How Much Do You Need to Retire?Your magic number, which is theamount you need to retire comfortably, is highly personalized. But there are rules of thumb that can give you an idea of how much to save.People used to say that you need around $1 million to retire comfortably.Other professionals use the 80% rule, which states that you need 80% of your current income to live comfortably after retiring. So if you made $100,000 per year, you would need savings that produce $80,000 per year for roughly 20 years, or a total of $1.6 million.Others say most of us aren’t saving anywhere near enough to meet those benchmarks and should adjust our lifestyles accordingly.Estimating ExpensesYour post-retirement expenses largely determine that \"magic number.\"It's a good idea to create a retirement budget, calculating estimated costs for housing, health insurance, food, clothing, and transportation.And since you'll have more free time on your hands, you may also want to factor in the cost of entertainment, hobbies, and travel.It may be hard to come up with concrete figures, but a reasonable estimate will be helpful.Steps to Retirement PlanningRegardless of where you are in life, there are several keysteps that apply to almost everyoneduring their retirement planning. The following are some of the most common:Come up with a plan. This includes deciding when you want to start saving when you want to retire, and how much you'd like to save for your ultimate goal.Decide how much you'll set aside each month. Using automatic deductions takes away the guesswork, keeps you on track, and takes awaythe temptation to stop or forgetdepositing money on your own.Choose the right accounts for you. Invest in a 401(k) or similar account if your employer offers that option. If the company offers an employer match and you don't sign up, you're giving away free money. Whether or not there's an employer match, you're getting a good deal tax-wise.Check on your investments from time to time and make adjustments. This is especially important after a big event, like marriage or a baby.Retirement PlansTax-advantaged retirement savings plans have become the keystone of long-term savings for Americans. You should have access to one or more of these plans depending on how you earn a living. Each has its own rules and regulations.Employer-Sponspored PlansMost large companies offer their employees401(k)plans. Nonprofit employers have similar403(b)plans.An up-front benefit of thesequalified retirement plansis that your employer has the option to match what you invest up to a certain amount. For example, if you contribute 3% of your annual income to your plan account, your employer may match that amount, depositing the sum into your retirement account along with your contribution.You can contribute more than the amount that will earn the employer match. Some experts recommend contributing upwards of 10%.401(k) LimitsThe maximum is revised yearly by the IRS Participants can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024 to a 401(k) or 403(b), some of which may be added to with anemployer match.People over age 50 can contribute an extra $7,500 per year as acatch-up contributionin 2024.These accounts can earn a much higher rate of return than a savings account (although the investments are not free of risk). The funds in the account, if it is a traditional account rather than a Roth account, are not taxed until you withdraw them. Since your contributions are taken off your gross income, you will get an immediate income tax break.Those who are on the cusp of a higher tax bracket might consider contributing enough to lower theirtax liability.Traditional Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)The traditionalindividual retirement account(IRA) is similar to a 401(k) plan but it can be obtained at virtually any bank or brokerage. It is primarily for self-employed people and others who have no access to a 401(k), but anyone with earned income can invest in an IRA.The money you save in an IRA is deducted from your income for the year, lowering your taxable income and, therefore, your tax liability.The tax benefit to this kind of account is upfront. So when it comes time to take distributions from the account, you are subject to your standard tax rate at that time. Keep in mind, though, that the money grows on a tax-deferred basis. There are nocapital gainsor dividend taxes that are assessed on the balance of your account until you begin making withdrawals.IRA LimitsThe IRS sets limits on how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA each year. The limit for 2024 is $7,000. People who are 50 and older can invest an additional $1,000 for a total of $8,000 in 2024.Distributionsmust be taken at age 72 and can be taken as early as 59½. You will owe taxes on the withdrawal at your regular income tax rate for that year.Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA)ARoth IRAis funded with post-tax dollars. This is a great variation on the IRA, with a little more pain upfront for a lot of gain down the road.The Roth IRA eliminates the immediate tax deduction of the traditional IRA. The money you pay into it is taxed in that year.However, you should owe no taxes when you start withdrawing money, either on the amount you put in or the investment gains it accrued.Starting a Roth IRA early can pay off big time in the long run, even if you don’t have a lot of money to invest at first. Remember, the longer the money sits in a retirement account, the more tax-free interest is earned.Roth LimitsThe 2024 contribution limit for either IRA (Roth or traditional) is $7,000 a year, or $8,000 if you are over age 50. A Roth has other restrictions, related to income. For instance:A single filer can contribute the full amount only if they make $146,000 or less annually, as of the 2024 tax year.After that, you can invest to a lesser degree, up to an annual income of $161,000 in 2024.Note that the income limits are higher for married couples filing jointly.As with a 401(k), a Roth IRA has some penalties associated with taking money outbefore you hit retirement age. But there are a few notable exceptions that may be useful in an emergency. First, you can always withdraw the money you invested (but not the gains it earned) without paying a penalty.SIMPLE Individual Retirement Account (IRA)TheSIMPLE IRAis a retirement account available toemployees of small businesses. It's an alternative to the 401(k), which is expensive for an employer to manage. It works the same way a 401(k) does, allowing employees to save money automatically through payroll deductions with the option of an employer match.This amount is capped at 3% of an employee's annual salary. The annual contribution limit for a SIMPLE IRA is $16,000 in 2024. Catch-up contributions of $3,500 allow employees 50 or older to bump that limit up to $19,500 in 2024.Once you set up a retirement account, the question becomes where to invest the money. You will be offered a choice, usually among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many also offer target-date funds, which automatically alter your selections over time, allocating more money towards conservative choices as you approach retirement age.Stages of Retirement PlanningBelow are some guidelines for successful retirement planning at different stages of your life.Young Adulthood (Ages 21–35)Those embarking on adult life may not have a lot of money free to invest, but they do have time to letinvestments mature, which is a critical piece of retirement savings. This is the principle ofcompounding.Compound interestallows interest to earn interest, and the more time you have, the more interest you will earn. If you can only put aside $50 a month, it will be worth three times more if you invest it at age 25 than if you wait to start investing until age 45,thanks to the joys of compounding.You might be able to invest more money in the future, but you’ll never be able to make up for that lost time.Some federal agencies and uniformed services offerthrift savings plans.Early Midlife (Ages 36–50)Early midlife tends to bring financial strains, including mortgages, student loans,insurance premiums, and credit card debt.Still, it’s critical to continue saving at this stage of retirement planning. The combination of earning more money and the time you still have to invest and earn interest makes these years some of the best for aggressive savings.People at this stage of retirement planning should continue to take advantage of any 401(k) matching programs that their employers offer. They should also try to max out contributions to a 401(k) or Roth IRA (you can have both at the same time). For those ineligible for a Roth IRA, consider atraditional IRA. As with your 401(k), this is funded with pretax dollars, and the assets within it grow tax-deferred.Some employer-sponsored plans offer a Roth option to set aside after-tax retirement contributions. You are limited to the same annual limit, but there areno income limitationsas with a Roth IRA.Finally, don’t neglect life insurance anddisability insurance. You want to ensure that your family can survive financially without pulling from retirement savings should something happen to you.Later Midlife (Ages 50–65)As you approach retirement, your investment accounts should become more conservative.Treasury bills (T-bills)are one of the most conservative investments, although their returns are also low compared to other investments.People in this age group have a few advantages. These often include higher wages as well as more disposable income than younger savers.It's never too late to set up and contribute to a 401(k) or an IRA. One benefit of this retirement planning stage is catch-up contributions. From age 50 on, you can contribute an additional $1,000 a year to your traditional or Roth IRA and an additional $7,500 a year to your 401(k) in 2024.Other InvestmentsThose who have maxed out their tax-incentivized retirement savings options can consider other forms of investment to supplement your retirement savings.Certificates of deposit(CDs), blue-chip stocks, or real estate investments (like a vacation home that you rent out) can be reasonably safe ways to add to yournest egg.You can also begin to get a sense of what yourSocial Security benefitswill be and at what age it makes sense to start taking them. Eligibility for early benefits starts at age 62, but the retirement age for full benefits is 66.This is the time to look intolong-term care insurance, which will help cover the costs of a nursing home or home care should you need it in your advanced years. If you don't properly plan for health-related expenses, especially unexpected ones, they can decimate your savings.The Social Security Administration (SSA) offers anonline calculatorto estimate your eventual monthly payment.Other Aspects of Retirement PlanningRetirement planning includes a lot more than simply how much you will save and how much you need. It takes into account your complete financial picture.Your HomeFor most Americans, the single biggest asset they own is their home. How does that fit into your retirement plan?A home was considered an asset in the past, but since the housing market crash, planners see it as less of an asset than they once did. With the popularity ofhome equity loansandhome equity lines of credit(HELOCs), many homeowners areentering retirement in mortgage debtinstead of well above water.Once you retire, there’s also the question of whether you should sell your home and downsize. If you still live in the home where you raised a family, it might be bigger and costlier than you need or want.Your retirement plan should include an unbiased look at your home and what to do with it.Estate PlanningYourestate planaddresses what happens to your assets after you die. It should include awillthat lays out your plans.But even before that, you should set up a trust or use some other strategy to keep as much of it as possible shielded from estate taxes.As of 2024, the first $13.61 million of an estate is exempt fromestate taxes(up from $12.92 million for 2023), but many people are finding ways to leave their money to their children in a way that doesn’t pay them in alump sum.There may also be changes coming down the pipeline in Congress regarding estate taxes, as the estate tax amount is scheduled to drop to $5 million in 2026.Tax EfficiencyOnce you reach retirement age and begin taking distributions, taxes become a bigger problem. Most of your retirement accounts are taxed as ordinary income tax.That’s one good argument for considering a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), as both allow you to pay taxes upfront rather than upon withdrawal.If you believe you will have a higher taxable income later in life, it may make sense to do a Roth conversion. An accountant or financial planner can help you work through such tax considerations.Medical InsuranceMedical expenses tend to increase with age. You will have government-sponsoredMedicarecoverage at a modest cost to you, but many supplement its coverage with a Medicare Advantage orMedigappolicy.Your choices are many and complex. It's a good idea to start checking out your options well in advance of retiring.How Do I Start a Retirement Plan?Retirement planning isn't difficult. It's as easy as setting aside some money every month—and every little bit counts.You can start with a tax-advantaged savings plan, either a 401(k) through an employer or an IRA through a bank or brokerage firm.You may also want to consider talking to a professional, such as a financial planner or investment broker who can steer you in the right direction.The earlier you start, the better. That's because your investments grow over time by earning interest. And you'll earn interest on that interest.Why Is a Retirement Plan So Important?A retirement plan helps yousock away enough money to maintain the same lifestyleyou currently have after you retire. While you may work part-time or pick up the odd gig here or there, it probably won't be enough to sustain your current lifestyle. Social Security benefits will only take you so far. That's why it's important to have a viable long-term plan for a financially comfortable retirement.What Are the Main Pieces of a Retirement Plan?A retirement plan is about accumulating enough money to enable you to enjoy a comfortable life after work. There are a couple of key issues to keep in mind:Consider how to minimize the taxes you owe on your retirement income. One way to do this is to sock away money in aRoth accountor convert your traditional account to a Roth before you retire.Don't overlook estate planning. You're taking care of your loved ones as you take care of yourself.What Are the Options Beyond a 401(k)?If you don't have access to a 401(k), you have a few options. You could open anindividual retirement account (IRA). However, the contribution limit for IRAs is much lower than for 401(k)s: $7,000 vs. $23,000, respectively.There's also thesolo 401(k)forself-employedworkers. You might consider annuity, but be careful: they're typicallyilliquidand come with high fees. You can also put money in a brokerage account, though this won't benefit from thetax advantagesof the accounts listed above.The Bottom LineEveryone dreams of the day they can finally say goodbye to the workforce. But doing so costs money. That's where retirement planning comes into play.It doesn't matter at what point you are in your life. Setting aside money now means you'll have less to worry about later.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

He has held positions in, and has deep experience with, expense auditing, personal finance, real estate, as well as fact checking & editing.Learn about oureditorial policiesWhat Is a Budget?A budget refers to an estimation ofrevenueandexpensesthat's made for a specified future period of time. Budgeting usually occurs on an ongoing basis, with individual budgets being re-evaluated regularly.Budgetscan be made for any entity thatneeds or wants to spend money, including governments and businesses, people, and households of any income level.Key TakeawaysA budget is an estimation of revenue and expenses utilized by governments, businesses, and individuals of any income level.A budget is a financial plan for a defined period that can greatly enhance the success of any financial undertaking.Corporate budgets are essential for operating at peak efficiency.Aside from earmarking resources, a budget can also aid in setting goals, measuring outcomes, and planning contingencies.Personal budgets are extremely useful in helping individuals and families manage their finances.Investopedia / Julie BangUnderstanding BudgetingA budget is a microeconomic concept that reveals the trade-off made when one good is exchanged for another. In terms of the bottom line—or the end result of this trade-off—asurplus budgetmeans profits are anticipated, abalanced budgetmeans revenues are expected to equal expenses, and adeficit budgetmeans expenses will exceed revenues. These principles hold true whether the budget is intended for an individual, a family, or a company.First, let's take a quick look at the budgeting process for a corporation, and then personal budgeting.Corporate BudgetsBudgets are an integral part of running any business efficiently and effectively.Budget Development ProcessCorporate budgeting begins by establishing assumptions for the upcoming budget period. These assumptions are related to projected sales trends, cost trends, and the overall economic outlook of the market,industry,orsector. Specific factors affecting potential expenses are addressed and monitored.The budget is published in a packet that outlines the standards and procedures used to develop it, including the assumptions about the markets, key relationships with vendors that provide discounts, and explanations of how certain calculations were made.The sales budget is often the first to be developed, as subsequent expense budgets cannot be established without knowing futurecash flows. Budgets are developed for all the different subsidiaries, divisions, and departments within an organization. For a manufacturer, a separate budget is often developed for direct materials, labor, and overhead.All budgets get rolled up into the master budget, which also includes budgetedfinancial statements, forecasts of cash inflows and outflows, and an overall financing plan. At a corporation, the top management reviews the budget and submits it for approval to the board of directors.Static vs. Flexible BudgetsThere are two major types of budgets:static budgetsand flexible budgets. A static budget remains unchanged over the life of the budget. Regardless of changes that occur during the budgeting period, all accounts and figures originally calculated remain the same.A flexible budget has a relational value to certain variables. The dollar amounts listed on a flexible budget change based on sales levels, production levels, or other external economic factors.Both types of budgets are useful for management. A static budget evaluates the effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides deeper insight into business operations.Advisor InsightDerek Notman, CFP®, ChFC, CLUIntrepid Wealth Partners, LLC, Madison, WIThe importance of budgeting cannot be understated. A budget, also known as cash flow, is arguably more important than the actual cash that you have in your bank and investment accounts. Your cash flow is what allows you to pay for everything (or not).Without knowing your cash flow, you could be putting yourself into a bad financial situation and not even know it. You can only get by without knowing your cash flow for so long before you get into financial trouble, so make the time to know the flow of your cash. Budgeting should be something that everyone does, regardless of their financial situation.Personal BudgetsIndividuals and families can have budgets, too.Creating and using a budgetis not just for those who need to closely monitor their cash flows from month to month because money is tight. Almost everyone can benefit from budgeting—even people with large paychecks and plenty of money in the bank may find it difficult to cover theexpense of an unexpected home repair.To manage your monthly expenses, prepare for life's unpredictable events, and afford big-ticket items without going into debt, budgeting is essential. Keeping track of how much you earn doesn't require you to be a math whiz and doesn't mean you can't buy the things you want.What it does mean is that you can maintain control over where your money goes and enjoy greater financial confidence and success.How to Create a BudgetThe specifics of budgeting will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. In most cases, though, the approach is the same no matter where you stand financially. Follow these seven steps to create your budget and adjust it as needed to reach specific financial goals.Add up all yourincome. This should include all income sources, such as awages, salaries, tips, Social Security payments, disability, alimony, and investment income.Calculate yourexpenses. These are expenses you must pay each month, such as yourmortgageor rent, food, transportation costs including gas, insurance premiums, taxes, childcare, internet service, your cell phone bill, and other utility payments.Identify debt payments. Be sure to include your debt, such asloansand credit card payments. Determine the minimum payment for each debt. Subtract that from your income as well.Review your spending. Keep track of every dollar you spend, whether you pay with a credit card or cash, to determine what your real expenses are. Keep your receipts and note down additional spending that you hadn't budgeted for.Create a spending plan. The amount of income you have left is what you can spend on discretionary expenses. These can include additional debt payments or rainy day savings. Your plan should also include things like entertainment or surprise expenses. Give every dollar a job, based on your goals and what you discovered when you tracked your spending.Set financial goals. Do you want to save money? Pay off debt? Stop spending more than you have? Decide on realistic goals. Remember, you can adjust these over time. Work on the most pressing goals first, such as paying off debt or creating an emergency fund.Adjust each month. Each month, look at your spending and whether you progressed toward or achieved goals, Reevaluate and adjust where you assign your discretionary spending. A flexible budget will help you avoid overspending.Once you've created a budget, you may have to do some juggling, especially in the first few months. This means adjusting spending here and there so that you stay within your planned budget for income and expenses. And be sure to put it in writing: If you see it and commit to it, you'll have more incentive to stick to it.11 Budgeting Myths That Can Block Your SuccessBudgeting is a wonderful tool for managing yourfinances, but many people think it's not for them. It's important to become aware of budgeting myths—the erroneous logic that stops people from keeping track of their money and allocating it in ways that benefit them most. Then, you can create a budget that can help you live within your means, reach important goals, and build lasting wealth. Here are 11 budgeting myths.1. I Don't Need to BudgetGetting and keeping a handle on your monthly income and expenses allows you to make sure that your hard-earned money is being put to its highest and best purpose. For those who enjoy an income that covers all bills with money left over, a budget can help maximize savings andinvestments.If one's monthly expenses typically consume the lion's share ofnet income, any budget should focus on identifying and classifying all the expenses that occur during the month, quarter, and year. And for people whose cash flow is tight, the budget can be crucial to identifying expenses that could be reduced or cut, and minimizing any wastefulinterestbeing paid on credit cards or other debt.2. I'm Not Great at MathGenerally speaking, you don't need to be great at math to make and follow a budget. First of all, understanding general concepts relating to your income, spending, debt, saving, and allocating your funds are important. Then, the basic ability to add and subtract is most of what's called for. That's especially true if you're budgeting manually, with pencil and paper.And now, thanks to budgeting software programs, math barely enters into it. You simply have to be able to follow instructions. Many of these programs are free and legitimate. Or, if you know how to use spreadsheet software, you can make your own ledger. It's as simple as creating one column for your income, another column for your expenses, and then keeping a running tab on the difference between the two.3. My Job Is SecureNo one's job is truly safe. If you work for a corporation, being laid off due to a difficult economy, downsizing, or atakeoveralways is a possibility. If you work for a small company, it could die with its owner, be bought out, or just fold.You should always be prepared for a job loss by having at least three months' worth of living expenses in the bank. It's easier to accumulate this financial cushion if you know the amount you're bringing in and spending each month, which can be monitored with a budget.4. Unemployment Insurance Will Tide Me OverUnemployment compensationis not a sure thing. Let's say a bad situation at work leaves you with no choice but to quit your job. Unless you can proveconstructive discharge(that is, that you were virtually forced to resign), your departure will be considered voluntary, making you ineligible for unemployment insurance. Besides, the benefits may fall well short of the wages you're used to: in even the highest paying states, the average is less than $500 per week.5. I Don't Want To Deprive MyselfBudgeting is not synonymous with spending as little money as possible or making yourself feel guilty about every purchase. The aim of budgeting is to make sure you're able to spend on what's needed and save a little each month, ideally at least 10% of your income. At the very least, budgeting can make sure that you aren't spending more than you earn.Unless you're on a very tight budget, you should be able to buy baseball tickets and go out to eat. Tracking your expenses does not change the amount of money you have available to spend every month. It just shows you where that money is going and allows you to make decisions about changing your spending habits.6. I Don't Want Anything BigIf you don't have any major savings goals (e.g., upsizing your living situation, starting your own business), it's hard to drum up the motivation to stash away extra cash each month. However, your situation and your attitudes likely will change over time.Let's say that you and your partnerlive in New York Cityin a small one-bedroom apartment and things are going fine for both of you until your family dynamic changes. For instance, you may have a child or an in-law who comes to stay with you indefinitely. This may mean you'll need (and want) more room to accommodate the new addition. If you don't save up for anything big, you may not be able to afford this change in your living situation down the road.7. I Won't Qualify for Student Financial AidYes, the catch-22 ofstudent financial aidis that the more money you have, the less aid you'll be eligible for. That's enough to make anyone wonder if it isn't better to spend it all and have no savings in order to qualify for the maximum amount of grants and loans.But that catch mainly applies toearned income. Whether you are an adult student going back to school or the parent of a student headed to college, theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)form (used forStafford Loans,Perkins Loans, orPell Grants), does not require you to report the value of your primary residence (if you own a home) or the value of your retirement accounts.So if you want to save money without compromising your financial aid eligibility, you can do so by using your savings to buy a house, prepay yourmortgage, or contribute more money to your retirement accounts. The savings that you put into these assets can still be accessed if you face an emergency, but you won't be penalized for it.Even if you employ all the available legal strategies to maximize your financial aid eligibility, you still won't always qualify for as much aid as you need. So it's not a bad idea to have your own source of funds to make up for any shortfall.8. I'm Debt-FreeGood for you! But being debt-free without any savings won't pay your bills in an emergency. A zero balance can quickly become a negative balance if you don't have a safety net. Budgeting can help you create one.9. I Always Get a Raise or Tax RefundIt's never a good idea to count on unpredictable sources of income. This may be the year that your company is unable to give you a raise (or as much of a raise as you hope for). The same is true ofbonusmoney.Tax refundsare more reliable, but this depends in part on how good you are at calculating your own tax liability.Some people know how to figure how much they'll get in a refund (or how much they will owe) as well as how to adjust this figure through changes in payrollwithholdingthroughout the year. However, changes intax deductions, IRS regulations, or other life events can mean a nasty surprise when you prepare your tax return.10. I Just Don't Have the DisciplineIf you're still not convinced that budgeting is for you, here's a way to protect yourself from your own spending habits. Set up an automatic transfer from yourchecking accountto asavings accountthat you don't see regularly (i.e., at a different bank). Schedule the transfer to happen right after you get paid.If you are saving for retirement, you may have the option of contributing a set amount regularly to a401(k)or other retirement savings plan. This way, you can pay yourself first, have enough money for the transfer, and know that you can meet your savings goal.11. It's a Luxury When I Barely Have Enough for the EssentialsSometimes budgeting just isn't a priority because you have too much on your plate. But there are certain government programs that can help you manage your household expenses. For instance, theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)helps recipients of all income levels work with their food budgets to make their benefits go further.At the very least, set up that budget so you get a feel for spending limits, any change in how you originally planned to allocate your funds, whether you're paying all you can to get rid of debt, or whether your slipping too far into debt.Budgeting ConceptsIn general, traditional budgeting starts with tracking expenses, eliminating debt, and, once the budget is balanced, building an emergency fund. But to speed up the process, you could start by building a partial emergency fund.Emergency FundThis emergency fund acts as a buffer as the rest of the budget is put in place and should replace the use ofcredit cardsfor emergency situations.The key is to build the fund at regular intervals, consistently devoting a certain percentage of each paycheck toward it, and if possible, putting in whatever you can spare on top. This will get you to think about your spending, too.You should only use your emergency fund for true emergencies. For instance, if you lose your job and need to pay for expenses, you could tap into your rainy day fund until you join the workforce again. You can also use this money if you have an unexpected medical emergency that arises.You would save money if you used your emergency fund to eliminatecredit card debt, but the purpose of the fund is to prevent you from having to use your credit card for paying for unexpected expenses. With a proper emergency fund, you will not need your credit card to keep you afloat when something goes wrong.Downsize and SubstituteOnce you have a buffer between you and high-interest debt, you can start the process of downsizing. The more space you can create between your expenses and your income, the more income you will have to pay down debt and invest.This can be a process of substitution as much as elimination. For example, cancel any recurring subscriptions that you don't regularly use or need. Use half of the money you save to invest for a goal or to pay off outstanding debts. Save the other half to bulk up your emergency fund.Althougheliminating expensesentirely is the fastest way to a solid budget, substitution tends to have more lasting effects. So consider:Shopping with friends and family so you can split the cost, especially if you buy in bulkCarpooling or taking public transportation to cut down on car-related costsPeople can sometimes cut too many expenses so that they end up with a budget that they can't stick to. Substitution, in contrast, keeps the basics while trimming costs.Find New Sources of IncomeOnce you have your budget in place and have more money coming in than going out, you can start investing to create more income.It is better to have no debt before you begin investing. If you are young, however, the rewards of investing inhigher-risk, high-returnsecurities like stocks can outweigh most low-interest debt over time.Keep your receipts so that you know exactly how much you spend each month. This can help you determine how much to budget for any expenses that may change from month to month.Sticking to a BudgetYou've got your budget set up. Now you've got to stick to it. But that credit card still calls your name, your clothes budget seems awfully small, and you feel deprived. At such moments, it helps to revisit the whole reason for a budget—to help you manage your finances, achieve financial goals, and lead a life free from fear of financial pitfalls.Remember the Big PictureYour budget can keep you out of overwhelming debt and help you build a financial future that will give you more freedom, not less. So think about the future you want and remember that keeping to your budget will help you get there. Adding to yourdebt load, on the other hand, will mean that your financial future could be less bright.Review Your SpendingEvery time you enter your spending in your software or budget notebook, review everything that's been spent to date and compare it to income received. This will keep you abreast of where things stand and encourage you to keep at it, especially if you are reining in your spending as intended. This daily or weekly activity can give you an enormous sense of accomplishment and keep you on track.Remove the Options That Allow You to CheatMake it more difficult to make impulse purchases. In other words, set up barriers that give you time to think: \"Is this purchase necessary?\" Opt out of retailer email lists. Remove your stored payment information on your favorite online shops so you can't just click to order. Adjust your phone settings to block tracking and advertising as much as possible.Find Some SupportIf you feel like you're the only one in your group who is on a budget, search for some like-minded folks. You could find an online forum, a monthly meeting, or even a couple of friends who will listen to your concerns and share their budgeting experiences. Set up accountability calls with your frugal buddies to talk things over and keep temptation at bay.Just know that you're not the only person setting sensible financial limits for yourself.Go Old SchoolThere's something powerful about handing over a stack of $20 bills for a purchase. You have to confront the money you're about to spend and accept that the spending is worth it. Swiping adebit card, on the other hand, may not feel nearly as real.Similarly, paying bills by writing checks and promptly entering the sums in your register keeps you up-to-date on how your account is affected in a way that autopay doesn't.You don't have to use cash exclusively or completely forgo online payments. But handling transactions in hands-on ways can make you realize how much you're spending and enhance the power of self-regulation.Reward YourselfIf you constantly look at what you have to give up, the very act of budgeting becomes distasteful. A mixture of long- and short-term gifts to yourself will help keep you motivated.When you've been faithful to your budget for a month, give yourself a reward. Even small ones such as a night out with friends, a concert, or a little extra cash for spending can help.Keep visual reminders of these rewards or the things you're saving up for. Start building associations in your brain that make sticking to your budget an enjoyable activity with happy results.Schedule a Periodic Budget EvaluationIt's difficult to predict correctly how much money you'll need in every category of your budget. For instance, a new job may necessitate a wardrobe change and your existing clothing budget may not cut it. That's why it's important to conduct a regular check on how well your budget is working. It may need tweaking. This is to be expected. Just make sure that you always keep your long-term financial goals in the picture.Educate YourselfLearn all you can about finances,money management, and how you can best invest in yourself. Talk to your financially savvy friends and seek out real-world tips and advice from people who are doing well with their money.The more you learn about handling money wisely and the rewards that can result from such an effort, the more concrete and acceptable the reasons for budgeting will be.8 Ways to Budget When You're BrokeBudgeting is smart, but if you're suffering from mounting bills and a lack of funds, it may not be where your focus is. In such circumstances, consider some additional steps that you can take to gain control of your finances.1. Avoid Immediate DisasterDon't be afraid to request bill extensions or payment plans from creditors. Skipping or delaying payments only worsens your debt. And late fees ding your credit score.2. Prioritize BillsGo over all your bills to see what can and should be paid first, prioritize those that are late, and then set up a payment schedule based on your paydays.Call the bill companies to see how much you can pay now to get back on track toward a positive status. Explain that you are taking strict measures to catch up. Be forthright about the amount you can afford to pay now. Don't just promise to pay the full amount later.3. Ignore the 10% Savings RuleStashing 10% of your income into yoursavings accountis daunting or impossible when you're living paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't make sense to have $100 in a savings plan if you are fending offdebt collectors. Your savings can wait until you can reclaim financial stability.4. Face Your SpendingTo fix your finances, you need to get a handle on your outlay first. Online banking and online budgeting software can help you categorize spending so you can make adjustments. Many people find that just by looking at aggregate figures fordiscretionary expenses, they are spurred to reduce excessive spending.5. Eliminate Unnecessary ExpensesHopefully, your budget has given you a sense of where your money goes. Now it's time to tighten up. Start cutting back on items that you wouldn't miss. Change habits that are costing you, like letting food spoil before you can eat it. Prepare meals at home instead of going to restaurants or getting takeout.You may be able to reduce some expenses that you shouldn't drop. For example, you might be able to lower your auto insurance premium by switching carriers.6. Negotiate Credit Card Interest RatesThose ultra-high interest rates on your credit cards aren't fixed in stone. Call the card company and ask for a reduction in theannual percentage rates (APR). If you have a good payment record, your request might be approved. This won't lower your outstanding balance, but it will keep it from mushrooming as fast.7. Track Your SpendingOnce you've gone through these steps, monitor your progress for a few months. You can do this by writing everything you spend in a notebook, withbudgeting appson your phone, or with the software you may already use for your budget.Ensure that every cent is accounted for. Fine-tune and adjust your spending as needed after each month. This not only can help get you out of financial trouble. It also can put the spotlight back on the importance of your budget.8. Seek New IncomeFor the time being, saving and investing is out. But consider ways to increase your earnings: working overtime, getting a second job, or picking up some freelance work.How Do You Create a Budget?Creating a budget takes some work. You'll need to calculate every type of income you receive each month. Next,track your spendingand tabulate all your monthly expenses, including your rent or mortgage, utility payments, debt, transportation costs, food, miscellaneous spending, and more. You may have to make some adjustments initially to stay within your budget. But once you've gone through the first few months, it should become easier to stick to it.What Is the 50-20-30 Budget Rule?The 50-20-30 budget rule was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in her bookAll Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan.The plan entails dividing all of your after-tax income into 50% for your actual needs, 30% for anything you want, and 20% for savings.How Does Budgeting Help a Business?Just like budgets help people, corporate budgeting helpsbusinesses stay on topof their finances. It also helps business leaders make very important investment decisions, manage and meet goals and objectives, and identify any financial hurdles that come their way.The Bottom LineA budget often conjures up images of complicated financial documents. But in reality, it's a money management tool that can be used by various entities, including governments, businesses, and individuals/households of every income level. Budgets can help prepare you to make better decisions about your money so that you can secure a brighter financial future.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

It is used to identify trading and investment opportunities.Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on financial information such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on price and volume to draw conclusions about future price movements.Key TakeawaysTechnical analysis is used to evaluate price trends and patterns and thereby identify potential investments and trading opportunities.Technical analysts believe past trading activity and a security's price changes can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements.Technical analysismay be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's financials rather than historical price patterns or stock trends.Technical analysis was introduced by Charles Dow.Investopedia / Candra HuffUnderstanding Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis is used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. It assumes that past trading activity and price changes of asecuritycan be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules.Technical analysis' various charting tools are often used to generate short-term trading signals. They can also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation estimate.Technical analysis as we know it today was first introduced byCharles Dowas the Dow Theory in the late 1800s.Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts. Nowadays, technical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research.How Technical Analysis Is UsedProfessional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics. But practicing equity analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone.Technical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks,futures,commodities, fixed-income securities, currencies, and more. In fact, technical analysis is prevalent in commodities andforexmarkets wheretradersfocus on short-term price movements.Technical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand. Some view technical analysis as simply the supply and demand forces reflected by the market price movements of a security.Technical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures.Technical Analysis IndicatorsHundreds of patterns and signals have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements.Some indicators focus primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas. Others focus on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation.Commonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators.In general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators:Price trendsChart patternsVolume andmomentumindicatorsOscillatorsMoving averagesSupport and resistance levelsThe CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools.Underlying Assumptions of Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis attempts to decipher the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for price patterns and trends.Charles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis theory. He had two basic assumptions that continue to form the framework for technical analysis trading.Markets are efficient with values that represent factors that influence a security's price.Even random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time.Today the field of technical analysis builds on Dow's work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions:The market discounts everything:Technical analysts believe that everything from a company's fundamentals to broad market factors tomarket psychologyis already priced into a stock. TheEfficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH)draws a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock.Price moves in trends:Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than to move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption.History tends to repeat itself:The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable and based on emotions such as fear and excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent price movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are believed to be relevant still because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.Fundamental Analysis vs. Technical AnalysisFundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used to research andforecast future trends in stock prices, and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries.Fundamental AnalysisFundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure theintrinsic valueof a stock. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies.Earnings,expenses, assets, and liabilities are all important characteristics of fundamental analysis that help analysts determine the fair value of a business.Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stock's price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all publicly known fundamentals have factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead,use stock charts to identify patternsand trends that suggest how a stock's price will move in the future.Limitations of Technical Analysis1.For some analysts and academic researchers, the EMH demonstrates why no actionable information is contained inhistorical priceand volume data. However, by the same reasoning, nor should business fundamentals provide actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH.2.Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled as a random walk.3.A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place astop-loss orderbelow the 200-day moving average of a certain company.If a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock price down, confirming the movement traders anticipated.Then, other traders will see the price decrease and sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset's price will be weeks or months from now.In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal. However, over the long run, this sole group of traders cannot drive the price.What Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make?Professional technical analysts typically assume three things. First, the market discounts everything. Second, prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. Third, history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable.What's the Difference Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis?Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. The core assumption of technical analysis, on the other hand, is that all known fundamentals are factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that might suggest how the security's price will move in the future.How Can I Learn Technical Analysis?Your first step is to learn about investing, stocks, markets, and financials. This can be done through books, online courses and materials, and in-person classes. Once you understand the basics, you can startstudying technical analysis.The Bottom LineTechnical analysis is a longstanding method of analyzing the price and volume data of securities to determine future price action. This data usually appears on charts. Investors and professional traders apply a variety of technical indicators to these price and volume charts to draw conclusions and make decisions about entry and exit points for trades.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

The result of such an analysis should give you the investment's true worth based on a company's financial health, the market, and economic conditions. Investors perform fundamental analysis to gauge whether or not to invest in a company based on it's current and projected worth.Key TakeawaysFundamental analysis is a method of determining a stock's intrinsic value.Fundamental analysts search for stocks trading at prices higher or lower than their real value.If the fair market value exceeds the market price, the stock is deemed undervalued, and a buy recommendation is given.If the fair market value is lower than the market price, the stock is overvalued, and the recommendation might be not to buy or to sell if the stock is held.In contrast, technical analysts favor studying the historical price trends of the stock to predict short-term future trends.Investopedia / Paige McLaughlinUnderstanding Fundamental AnalysisWhen performing fundamental analysis, you study the company's revenue growth, profitability, and competitive advantages within its industry. You also assess macroeconomic factors such as the overall state of the economy and the demand for the company's products or services. It also takes into account the effectiveness of the company's management team. A skilled and experienced leadership team can navigate challenges and seize opportunities, driving the company's growth and increasing its value.This approach to the market often allows you to see behind investor sentiment and company marketing to determine whether the company has the potential for long-term success. With fundamental analysis, you can then gauge if the security's market price is over- or undervalued.Fundamental analysis typically starts by analyzing a company's financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. The information in these materials can be used to calculate and assess a company's financial health and intrinsic value. Key ratios derived from these financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, earnings per share (EPS), return on equity (ROE), and debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio, among others. Fundamental analysts use measures like these to determine whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued relative to its market price and competitors.In addition, fundamental analysis frequently involves looking at gross domestic product, inflation, unemployment rates, industry or sector trends, and the company's competition. Fundamental analysis thus takes how a company should perform, not just in the market, but as a producer of goods and services. This requires looking at the overall economy, sector performance, and the company's position within the industry to estimate its value and forecast future performance. This approach not only considers economic and financial data but also often includes reviewing its business model, management effectiveness, brand awareness, and potential for growth and profitability.Ultimately, fundamental analysis aims to give you a number, a value, for the company you can use when buying, holding, or selling stocks. It requires a comprehensive understanding of financial statements and a strategic view of how external factors could impact the company's future earnings and market position.Why Is Fundamental Analysis Important?Fundamentals allow investors to look beyond short-term price fluctuations and focus on the underlying factors that drive a company's operations and long-term performance.The main benefit of fundamental analysis is to help quantify the value of a company and its shares. Financial statements offer hard data that reveal insights into a company's profitability,liquidity, and overall financial stability. This information, along with an assessment of the company's management team, competitive advantages, and industry trends, furnishes a picture of the company's fair or target value. With this knowledge, investors can make more informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling a particular stock.Fundamental analysis can also help investors identify undervalued companies. By considering a company's sales growth, market share, and product pipeline, investors can gauge its ability to increase future profits and grow shareholder value. By investing in companies with solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects, investors can benefit from long-term trends and capitalize on emerging prospects.Value investors, in particular, look for undervalued shares relative to their fundamental potential.Finally, fundamental analysis can help you spot red flags and overvalued investments. By researching a company's financial health and market position, investors can more easily avoid stocks that may be more likely to underperform or experience significant downturns. This is especially important during economic uncertainty or market volatility when a company's underlying strength can be the difference between weathering the storm and being pushed out of the market altogether.Where to Find Fundamentals for a CompanySome of the most common and reliable sources for the fundamentals of a company include the following:Company filings: Public companies are required to file regular reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), such asForm 10-K(annual report), Form 10-Q (quarterly report), and Form 8-K (current events report). These filings contain detailed financial statements, management discussions and analyses, and other important information about the company. You can access these filings for free on the SEC's EDGAR database.Company website:Most publicly traded companies have an investor relations section that provides financial statements, earnings releases, investor presentations, and other relevant information for shareholders and potential investors. Transcripts of earnings reports can be particularly helpful since company leads typically find it necessary to address company soft spots for journalists.Financial platforms: Yahoo! Finance, Google Finance, and MarketWatch, among others, provide financial news, analysis, and fundamental data on publicly traded companies, including financial statements, key ratios, and analyst ratings.Broker research reports: Many brokerage firms supply research reports on companies they and their affiliates cover, often with detailed fundamental analysis and investment recommendations.Financial data providers: Subscription-based financial data providers such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and Morningstar offer extensive fundamental data and analysis on companies, industries, and markets. Subscriptions are often pricey, so they are more typically used by professional investors and analysts.Industry trade journals: Trade publications covering specific industries can provide valuable insights on industry trends, competitive dynamics, and company-specific developments that inform your fundamental analysis.Remember, when conducting fundamental analysis, it's essential to use several sources to get a well-rounded view of a company's financial prospects and to be aware of any potential biases or conflicts of interest in the information you're receiving.Fundamental analysis is used most often for stocks, but it can be useful for evaluating any security, from a bond to a derivative. If you consider the fundamentals, from the broader economy to the company details, you are doing a fundamental analysis.How to Read a Company's Annual ReportReading a company'sannual reportis an essential part of fundamental analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to read and analyze an annual report:Start with the CEO's letter to shareholders: This section gives an overview of the company's performance, key developments, and outlook from the perspective of top management. Pay attention to the tone and content of the letter, as it can give insights into the company's strategy, challenges, and prospects.Review the business description: This section describes the company's main products or services, target markets, competitive advantages, and key risks. It can help you understand the company's business model and the factors that drive its success.Analyze the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A): TheMD&Aprovides a detailed discussion of the company's financial performance, including revenue and expense trends, cash flows, and key financial ratios. It also has management's perspective on the factors that affect the company's performance and outlook for the future.Examine the financial statements: The annual report has the company's audited financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Review these carefully while looking for trends in revenue, expenses, profits, assets, liabilities, and cash flows. From there, you can compute the critical financial ratios.Read the notes to the financial statements: The notes (orfootnotes) provide additional details and explanations about the company's accounting policies, significant transactions, and other important information that may not be clear from the financial statements alone.Review the auditor's report: This provides an independent opinion on whether the financial statements fairly present the company's financial position and performance following generally accepted accounting principles. Look for any qualified opinions or disclaimers that may indicate potential issues.Analyze the company's corporate governance: The annual report often has information on the company's board of directors, executive compensation, and other corporate governance matters. Consider whether the company's governance practices align with the interests of shareholders and whether there are any red flags, such as conflicts of interest or excessive compensation.Look for additional disclosures: The annual report may include additional disclosures about legal proceedings, regulatory issues, or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that could impact the company's performance and reputation.A Closer Look at Financial StatementsThe information in financial statements is among the most valuable about a company's financial health and performance. Here's a breakdown of what you can learn from each one:Income Statement:This shows how much money a company is making (revenue), how much they're spending (expenses), and then what's left over (profit or loss). By looking at trends in revenue and expenses over time, you can get a sense of whether the company is growing or struggling. You can also calculate important ratios like the company's profit margin, which tells you how much of each dollar in sales the company gets to keep as profit.Balance Sheet: This gives you a snapshot of what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what is left over (shareholders' equity). This can help you assess a company's financial stability and liquidity. For example, if a company has a lot more assets than liabilities, that's generally a good sign. You can also look at how much debt the company has relative to its equity to understand its financial leverage and risk.Statement of Cash Flows: This shows how much cash is coming in and going out of the company over a given period. It's broken down into three main categories:cash from operations(the money generated by the company's core business activities), cash from investing (the money spent or earned from investments not related to the core business), and cash from financing (the money raised or paid out and used to fund the business). By looking at a company's cash flows, you can better understand its ability to generate cash, pay its bills, and invest in growth.The cash flow statement is crucial because it's harder for a business to manipulate its cash situation. An aggressive accountant can do plenty of things to manipulate earnings, for example, but it's tough to fake cash in the bank. For this reason, some investors use the cash flow statement as a more conservative measure of a company's performance.A \"balance sheet\" gets its name because the three sections it contains—assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity—must balance out using this formula:Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' EquityQuantitative and Qualitative Fundamental AnalysisThe problem with defining the \"fundamentals\" is that they can cover anything related to a company's economic well-being. They can include numbers like revenue and profit, but they can also include anything from a company's market share to the quality of its management. Generally, these are all grouped into two categories: quantitative and qualitative:Quantitative: information that can be shown using numbers, figures, ratios, or formulasQualitative:rather than a quantity of something, it is its quality, standard, or natureIn this context, quantitative fundamentals are hard numbers, the measurable characteristics of a business. The most significant source of quantitative data is financial statements. The qualitative fundamentals are less tangible. They might include the quality of a company's key executives, brand-name recognition, patents, andproprietary technology. Neither qualitative nor quantitative analysis is inherently better. Many analysts consider them together.Fundamental analysis relies on using financial ratios drawn from data on corporate financial statements to make inferences about a company's value and prospects.Qualitative Fundamentals to ConsiderThere are certainqualitativefundamentals that analysts should always consider when analyzing a company. These include the following:The Business Model:What exactly does the company do? This isn't always straightforward. If a company's business model is based on selling fast-food chicken, is it making its money that way? Or is it coasting on royalty and franchise fees?Competitive Advantage: A company's long-term success is primarily driven by its ability to maintain its competitive advantage. Competitive advantages, such as Coca-Cola Co.'s (KO) brand name and Microsoft Corporation's (MSFT) long domination of the personal computer operating system, create amoataround a business, allowing it to keep competitors at bay and enjoy growth and profits.Management Team:Some think management is the most important criterion for investing in a company. This makes sense: Even the best business model is doomed if the company's leaders fail to execute the plan properly. While it's hard for retail investors to meet and truly evaluate managers, you can look at the corporate website and check the resumes of the top brass and the board members. How well did they do in previous jobs? Have they been unloading a lot of their stock shares lately?Corporate Governance and Board Structure: These are provided by the policies within an organization indicating the relationships and responsibilities among management, directors, andstakeholders. These policies are defined and determined in the company charter, its bylaws, and corporate laws and regulations. You want to do business with a company that is run ethically, fairly, transparently, and efficiently. Note whether management respects shareholder rights and shareholder interests. Ensure their communications to shareholders are transparent and understandable. If you don't get it, if there are major issues you know surround the company and they aren't addressed, it's not a sign that they have good answers for you.Industry Trends: It's also important to consider a company's industry: its customer base,market shareamong firms, industrywide growth, competition, regulation, and business cycles. Learning how the industry works will give an investor a deeper understanding of a company's financial health.Stakeholder Satisfaction:Employees, managers, customers, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders should all have positive views on the company and its prospects. Without that, a company'sbrand equityand image can suffer, which can lead to fewer sales, lower profits, and flagging share prices.Quantitative Fundamentals to Consider: Financial RatiosFinancial statements are how a company discloses information about its financial performance. Here are some of the most important financial ratios with their formulas:Key Financial RatiosCategoryRatioFormulaProfitabilityGross profit margin(Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / RevenueHigher margins and returns generally indicate a more profitable and efficient business.Operating profit marginOperating Income / RevenueNet profit MarginNet Income / RevenueReturn on assets (ROA)Net Income / Average Total AssetsReturn on equity (ROE)Net Income / Average Shareholders' EquityLiquidityCurrent ratioCurrent Assets / Current LiabilitiesA higher ratio suggests that the company has enough liquidity to cover its near-term liabilities.Quick ratio(Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) / Current LiabilitiesSolvencyDebt-to-equity ratioTotal Liabilities / Total Shareholders' EquityThese ratios measure a company's ability to meet its long-term debt obligations. Lower debt ratios and higher interest coverage ratios generally indicate a more financially stable company.Debt-to-assets ratioTotal Liabilities / Total AssetsInterest coverage ratioOperating Income / Interest ExpenseEfficiencyAsset turnover ratioRevenue / Average Total AssetsThese ratios measure how effectively a company manages its assets to generate sales. Higher turnover ratios suggest that the company is using its assets more efficiently to generate revenue.Inventory turnover ratioCost of Goods Sold / Average InventoryReceivables turnover ratioRevenue / Average Accounts ReceivableValuationP/EMarket Price per Share / Earnings per ShareLower ratios may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while higher ratios may suggest that it is overvalued.Price-to-book (P/B) ratioMarket Price per Share / Book Value per SharePrice-to-sales (P/S) ratioMarket Price per Share / Revenue per ShareDividend yieldAnnual Dividends per Share / Market Price per ShareFundamental Analysis vs. Technical AnalysisFundamental analysis contrasts starkly withtechnical analysis,which attempts to forecast prices by analyzing historical market data such as price and volume. Technical analysis uses price trends and action, often plotted on charts, to create indicators and identify patterns. Some indicators develop patterns that have names resembling their shapes, such as the \"head and shoulders\" pattern.A major distinction is where \"value\" comes from. For technical analysts, the market sets prices, and hence, the changes there give a company its value. For fundamental analysts, there is an intrinsic value that the market can often miss.Fundamental vs. Technical AnalysisFundamental AnalysisEstimates the intrinsic value of a company from its operationsConsiders a company's financial statements and qualitative factorsLonger-term focus (months/years)Best for buy-and hold investingTechnical AnalysisLooks at price and market trends to uncover market psychologyConsiders historical prices and chart patternsShorter-term focus (days/weeks)Best for short-term or swing tradingLimitations of Fundamental AnalysisThough fundamental analysis can provide investors with insights into the future of a company, it does come with some downsides. Keep these items in mind when performing fundamental analysis:It's Time-Consuming: Fundamental analysis involves a detailed examination of financial statements, economic data, industry reports, and company-specific factors. This process requires collecting extensive data, performing complex calculations, and interpreting various financial metrics - which all times time (which leads into the next downside....).It's A Lagging Indicator: In addition to being a slow process, fundamental analysis often acts as alagging indicatorbecause it relies on financial data that reflects past performance. By the time changes in a company’s fundamentals become apparent in its financial statements, the stock price might have already adjusted.Relies on Historical Data: Similarly, fundamental analysis is based largely on historical financial information. While this data provides a basis for estimating future performance, it may not fully capture future risks or opportunities, as past performance is not an indicator of what's to come in the future.Subject to Accounting Practices: The accuracy of fundamental analysis depends on the integrity and transparency of a company’s financial statements. Keep in mind that things like management estimates, depreciation, or otherGAAP-compliantrequirements can (perhaps improperly) impact the fundamental analysis.Difficult to Value Intangibles: Intangible assets like patents, trademarks, brand reputation, and human capital are increasingly important in today’s economy. However, these assets are challenging to quantify and may not be fully reflected in a company’s financial statements. Consider how some investors would have believed in Apple simply because ofSteve Jobs; that notion is not captured in fundamental analysis.Economic Assumptions: Fundamental analysis often involves assumptions about future economic conditions such as interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Again, these are always changing and may not materialize as expected.Overlooked Short-Term Opportunities: Fundamental analysis is geared towards long-term investment decisions, focusing on a company’s intrinsic value and potential for growth over time. This long-term focus might cause investors to miss short-term trading opportunities that technical analysis can identify such as price patterns, volume spikes, or momentum indicators.Example of Fundamental AnalysisLet's analyze a hypothetical company called ABC Inc. using fundamental analysis. We'll examine its financial statements and calculate key ratios to assess its financial health and performance.First, let's look at some data from ABC Inc.'s financial statements for the previous fiscal year:ABC Income Statement & Balance SheetIncome Statement($ millions).Balance Sheet($ millions)Revenue$1,000.AssetsCost of Goods Sold$600.Current Assets$750Gross Profit$400.Cash$200Operating Expenses$200.Marketable Securities$250Operating Income$200.Accounts Receivable$300Net Income$150.Non-Current Assets$750.Total Assets$1,500.------------------.Liabilities.Current Liabilities$250.Non-Current Liabilities250.Total Liabilities$500..Shareholder Equity$1,000ABC Statement of Cash Flows & Stock InformationCash Flows from:($ millions).Stock InformationOperations$250.# Shares Outstanding100 millionInvestments$100.Stock Price$25.00Financing$150.Now, let's calculate some key ratios:Profitability Ratios:Gross profit margin = ($1,000 - $600) / $1,000 = 40%Operating profit margin = $200 / $1,000 = 20%Net profit margin = $150 / $1,000 = 15%Return on assets (ROA) = $150 / $1,500 = 10%Return on equity (ROE) = $150 / $1,000 = 15%ABC Inc.'s profitability ratios suggest that the company is generating healthy profits from its operations. Its gross margin is 40%, operating margin is 20%, and net margin is 15%. Its ROA and ROE of 10% and 15%, respectively, indicate that the company is generating solid returns on its assets and equity.Liquidity Ratios:Current ratio = $750 / $250 = 3.00Quick ratio = ($200 + $150 + $200) / $250 = 2.20Assuming ABC Inc.'s current assets are $750 million, with $200 million in cash, $150 million in marketable securities, and $200 million in accounts receivable, and its current liabilities are $250 million, the company's liquidity ratios are strong. A current ratio of 3.0 and a quick ratio of 2.2 suggest that ABC Inc. has ample liquidity to cover its short-term obligations.Solvency Ratios:Debt-to-equity ratio = $500 / $1,000 = 0.50Debt-to-assets ratio = $500 / $1,500 = 0.33ABC Inc.'s solvency ratios indicate that the company has a manageable level of debt relative to its equity and assets. A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 and a debt-to-assets ratio of 0.33 suggest that the company is not overly leveraged and has the financial flexibility to meet its long-term obligations.Valuation Ratios(Assuming ABC Inc. has 100 million shares outstanding and its stock price is $25 per share):Price-to-earnings (P/E) Ratio = $25 / ($150 / 100) = 16.67Price-to-book (P/B) Ratio = $25 / ($1,000 / 100) = 2.50Price-to-sales (P/S) Ratio = $25 / ($1,000 / 100) = 2.50ABC Inc.'s valuation ratios suggest that the company's stock is trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings, book value, and sales. A P/E ratio of 16.67 aligns with the broader market, while P/B and P/S ratios of 2.5 indicate that the stock is not overly expensive relative to the company's assets and revenue.In addition to these quantitative measures, we can also consider certain qualitative fundamentals:Competitive Advantages:Has strong brand recognition in its industry and high customer loyaltyProprietary technology that differentiates its products from competitorsEfficient supply chain and distribution network, enabling faster delivery and lower costsManagement Quality:It has an experienced management team with a proven track record of success.The CEO has been with the company for 15 years and has led the company through several periods of growth.Management has demonstrated a commitment to creating new goods and services and has strategic investments in research and development.Industry Trends:The industry in which ABC Inc. operates is growing at a steady rate of 5% per year.There's increasing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable products, which aligns with ABC Inc.'s product offerings.The regulatory environment is becoming more favorable for the company's products.Growth Prospects:ABC Inc. has a robust pipeline of new products set to launch in the next 12-18 months.The company has been expanding into new geographic markets and plans to enter two new countries next year.Recent acquisitions have provided opportunities for synergies and increased market share.Corporate Governance:ABC Inc. has a diverse and independent board of directors.The company has a strong track record of transparency and timely financial reporting.Executive compensation is aligned with long-term shareholder interests.ESGFactors:ABC Inc. has set ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint and increasing its use of renewable energy.The company is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, with programs in place to promote a diverse workforce.ABC Inc. engages with local communities and supports various philanthropic initiatives.Based on this hypothetical fundamental analysis, ABC Inc. appears to be a financially healthy and potentially attractive investment. However, it's important to remember that this is just a simplified example. In practice, investors would need to conduct a more thorough analysis, considering the company's competitive position, industry trends, management quality, and growth prospects, before making an investment decision.What Is Fundamental Analysis and Its Objective?Fundamental analysis uses publicly available financial information and reports to determine whether a stock and the issuing company are valued correctly by the market.What Are the 3 Layers of Fundamental Analysis?When conducting an analysis, you can betop-downand start with economic analysis, then analyze the industry, then the company. Or, you can bebottom-upand work in the reverse order.What Are the Tools for Fundamental Analysis?Analysts use many tools. Some examples are financial reports, ratios from the reports, spreadsheets, charts, graphs, infographics, government agency reports on industries and the economy, and market reports.How Does Fundamental Analysis Differ From Technical Analysis?Fundamental analysis focuses on evaluating a security's intrinsic value based on financial and economic factors, while technical analysis studies price movements and trading volumes to identify patterns and predict future price movements.Why Is Earnings Per Share (EPS) Important in Fundamental Analysis?EPS indicates a company’s profitability on a per-share basis, helping investors determine how much profit a company generates for each share of its stock. It is a critical metric for assessing company performance and valuing stocks.The Bottom LineFundamental analysis is used to value a company and determine whether a stock is over- or undervalued by the market. It considers the economic, market, sector-specific, and financial performance.Financial ratios generated from financial reports and government industry and economic reports are used to assess a company. Not every analyst uses the same tools or views stocks similarly—you might determine a stock is valued differently than another analyst. What's important is that the stock you analyze meets your criteria for value and that your analysis creates actionable information.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset.Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they decide against it.Each options contract will have a specific expiration date by which the holder must exercise their option. The stated price on an option is known as the strike price. Options are typically bought and sold throughonline or retail brokers.Key TakeawaysOptions are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date.Call options and put options form the basis for a wide range of option strategies designed for hedging, income, or speculation.Options trading can be used for both hedging and speculation, with strategies ranging from simple to complex.Although there are many opportunities to profit with options, investors should carefully weigh the risks.Investopedia / Michela ButtignolUnderstanding OptionsOptions are versatile financial products. These contracts involve a buyer and seller, where the buyer pays a premium for the rights granted by the contract.Call optionsallow the holder to buy the asset at a stated price within a specific time frame.Put options, on the other hand, allow the holder to sell the asset at a stated price within a specific time frame. Each call option has a bullish buyer and a bearish seller while put options have a bearish buyer and a bullish seller.Traders and investors buy and sell options for several reasons. Options speculation allows a trader to hold a leveraged position in an asset at a lower cost than buying shares of the asset. Investors use options to hedge or reduce the risk exposure of their portfolios.In some cases, the option holder can generate income when they buy call options or become an options writer. Options are also one of the most direct ways to invest in oil. For options traders, an option's daily trading volume and open interest are the two key numbers to watch to make the most well-informed investment decisions.American options can be exercised at any time before their expiration date, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date or the exercise date.Exercising means utilizing the right to buy or sell the underlying security.Types of OptionsCallsA call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at the strike price on or before expiration. A call option will therefore become more valuable as the underlying security rises in price (calls have a positive delta).A long call can be used to speculate on the price of the underlying rising, since it has unlimited upside potential but the maximum loss is the premium (price) paid for the option.PutsOpposite to call options, a put gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to instead sell the underlying stock at the strike price on or before expiration. A long put, therefore, is a short position in the underlying security, since the put gains value as the underlying's price falls (they have a negative delta).Protective putscan be purchased as a sort of insurance, providing a price floor for investors to hedge their positions.American vs. European OptionsAmerican optionscan be exercised at any time between the date of purchase and the expiration date.European optionsare different from American options in that they can only be exercised at the end of their lives on their expiration date.The distinction betweenAmerican and European optionshas nothing to do with geography, only with early exercise. Many options on stock indexes are of the European type. Because the right to exercise early has some value, an American option typically carries a higher premium than an otherwise identical European option. This is because the early exercise feature is desirable and commands a premium.In the U.S., most single stock options are American while index options are European.Special ConsiderationsOptions contractsusually represent 100 shares of the underlying security. The buyer pays a premium fee for each contract.For example, if an option has a premium of 35 cents per contract, buying one option costs $35 ($0.35 x 100 = $35). The premium is partially based on thestrikeprice or the price for buying or selling the security until the expiration date.Another factor in the premium price is theexpiration date. Just like with that carton of milk in the refrigerator, the expiration date indicates the day the option contract must be used. The underlying asset will influence the use-by date and some options will expire daily, weekly, monthly, and even quarterly. For monthly contracts, it is usually the third Friday.Options SpreadsOptions spreads are strategies that use various combinations of buying and selling different options for the desired risk-return profile. Spreads are constructed usingvanilla options, and can take advantage of various scenarios such as high- or low-volatility environments, up- or down-moves, or anything in-between.Spread strategiescan be characterized by their payoff or visualizations of their profit-loss profile, such asbull call spreadsoriron condors.Options Risk Metrics: The GreeksThe options market uses the term the \"Greeks\" to describe the different dimensions ofrisk involved in taking an options position, either in a particular option or a portfolio. These variables are called Greeks because they are typically associated with Greek symbols.Each risk variable is a result of an imperfect assumption or relationship of the option with another underlying variable. Traders use different Greek values to assess optionsriskand manage option portfolios.DeltaDelta(Δ) represents therate of changebetween the option's price and a $1 change in theunderlying asset'sprice. In other words, the price sensitivity of the option relative to the underlying. Delta of a call option has a range between zero and one, while the delta of aput optionhas a range between zero and negative one. For example, assume an investor is long a call option with a delta of 0.50. Therefore, if the underlying stock increases by $1, the option's price would theoretically increase by 50 cents.Delta also represents thehedge ratiofor creating adelta-neutralposition for options traders.So if you purchase a standard American call option with a 0.40 delta, you need to sell 40 shares of stock to be fully hedged. Net delta for a portfolio of options can also be used to obtain the portfolio's hedge ratio.Aless common usage of an option's deltais the current probability that it will expirein-the-money. For instance, a 0.40 delta call option today has an implied 40% probability of finishing in-the-money.ThetaTheta(Θ) represents the rate of change between the option price and time, or time sensitivity - sometimes known as an option's time decay. Theta indicates the amount an option's price would decrease as the time to expiration decreases, all else equal. For example, assume an investor is long an option with a theta of -0.50. The option's price would decrease by 50 cents every day that passes, all else being equal. If three trading days pass, the option's value would theoretically decrease by $1.50.Theta increases when options are at-the-money, and decreases when options are in- and out-of-the money. Options closer to expiration also have accelerating time decay.Long calls and long puts usually have negative Theta. Short calls and short puts, on the other hand, have positive Theta. By comparison, an instrument whose value is not eroded by time, such as a stock, has zero Theta.GammaGamma(Γ) represents the rate of change between an option's delta and the underlying asset's price. This is called second-order (second-derivative) price sensitivity. Gamma indicates the amount the delta would change given a $1 move in the underlying security. Let's assume an investor is long one call option on hypothetical stock XYZ. The call option has a delta of 0.50 and a gamma of 0.10. Therefore, if stock XYZ increases or decreases by $1, the call option's delta would increase or decrease by 0.10.Gamma is used to determine the stability of an option's delta. Higher gamma values indicate that delta could change dramatically in response to even small movements in the underlying's price. Gamma is higher for options that areat-the-moneyand lower for options that are in- and out-of-the-money, and accelerates in magnitude as expiration approaches.Gamma values are generally smaller the further away from the date of expiration. This means that options with longer expirations are less sensitive to delta changes. As expiration approaches, gamma values are typically larger, as price changes have more impact on gamma.Options traders may opt to not only hedge delta but also gamma in order to bedelta-gamma neutral, meaning that as the underlying price moves, the delta will remain close to zero.VegaVega(V) represents the rate of change between an option's value and the underlying asset'simplied volatility. This is the option's sensitivity to volatility. Vega indicates the amount an option's price changes given a 1% change in implied volatility. For example, an option with a Vega of 0.10 indicates the option's value is expected to change by 10 cents if the implied volatility changes by 1%.Because increased volatility implies that the underlying instrument is more likely to experience extremevalues, a rise in volatility correspondingly increases the value of an option. Conversely, a decrease in volatility negatively affects the value of the option.Vega is at its maximum for at-the-money options that have longer times until expiration.Those familiar with the Greek language will point out that there is no actual Greek letter named vega. There are various theories about how this symbol, which resembles the Greek letter nu, found its way into stock-trading lingo.RhoRho(p) represents the rate of change between an option's value and a 1% change in theinterest rate. This measures sensitivity to the interest rate. For example, assume a call option has a rho of 0.05 and a price of $1.25. If interest rates rise by 1%, the value of the call option would increase to $1.30, all else being equal. The opposite is true for put options. Rho is greatest for at-the-money options with long times until expiration.Minor GreeksSome other Greeks, which aren't discussed as often, arelambda, epsilon,vomma, vera, speed,zomma, color, ultima.These Greeks are second- or third-derivatives of the pricing model and affect things like the change in delta with a change in volatility. They are increasingly used in options trading strategies as computer software can quickly compute and account for these complex and sometimes esoteric risk factors.Advantages and Disadvantages of OptionsBuying Call OptionsAs mentioned earlier, call options allow the holder to buy an underlying security at the stated strike price by the expiration date called the expiry. The holder has no obligation to buy the asset if they do not want to purchase the asset. The risk to the buyer is limited to the premium paid. Fluctuations of the underlying stock have no impact.Buyers are bullish on a stock and believe the share price will rise above the strike price before the option expires. If the investor's bullish outlook is realized and the price increases above the strike price, the investor can exercise the option, buy the stock at the strike price, and immediately sell the stock at the current market price for a profit.Their profit on this trade is the market share price less the strike share price plus the expense of the option—the premium and any brokerage commission to place the orders. The result is multiplied by the number of option contracts purchased, then multiplied by 100—assuming each contract represents 100shares.If the underlying stock price does not move above the strike price by the expiration date, the option expires worthlessly. The holder is not required to buy the shares but will lose the premium paid for the call.Selling Call OptionsSelling call options is known as writing a contract. The writer receives the premium fee. In other words, a buyer pays the premium to the writer (or seller) of an option. The maximum profit is the premium received when selling the option. An investor who sells a call option is bearish and believes the underlying stock's price will fall or remain relatively close to the option's strike price during the life of the option.If the prevailing market share price is at or below the strike price by expiry, the option expires worthlessly for the call buyer. The option seller pockets the premium as their profit. The option is not exercised because the buyer would not buy the stock at the strike price higher than or equal to the prevailingmarket price.However, if the market share price is more than the strike price at expiry, the seller of the option must sell the shares to an option buyer at that lower strike price. In other words, the seller must either sell shares from theirportfolioholdings or buy the stock at the prevailing market price to sell to the call option buyer. The contract writer incurs a loss. How large of a loss depends on the cost basis of the shares they must use to cover the option order, plus any brokerage orderexpenses, but less any premium they received.As you can see, the risk to thecall writersis far greater than the risk exposure of call buyers. The call buyer only loses the premium. The writer faces infinite risk because the stock price could continue to rise increasing losses significantly.Buying Put OptionsPut options are investments where the buyer believes the underlying stock's market price will fall below the strike price on or before the expiration date of the option. Once again, the holder can sell shares without the obligation to sell at the stated strike per share price by the stated date.Since buyers of put options want the stock price to decrease, the put option is profitable when the underlying stock's price is below the strike price. If the prevailing market price is less than the strike price at expiry, the investor can exercise the put. They will sell shares at the option's higher strike price. Should they wish to replace their holding of these shares they may buy them on the open market.Their profit on thistradeis the strike price less the current market price, plus expenses—the premium and any brokerage commission to place the orders. The result would be multiplied by the number of option contracts purchased, then multiplied by 100—assuming each contract represents 100 shares.The value of holding a put option will increase as the underlying stock price decreases. Conversely, the value of the put option declines as the stock price increases. The risk of buying put options is limited to the loss of the premium if the option expires worthlessly.Selling Put OptionsSelling put options is also known as writing a contract. A put option writer believes the underlying stock's price will stay the same or increase over the life of the option, making them bullish on the shares. Here, the option buyer has the right to make the seller, buy shares of the underlying asset at the strike price on expiry.If the underlying stock's price closes above the strike price by the expiration date, the put option expires worthlessly. The writer's maximum profit is the premium. The option isn't exercised because the option buyer would not sell the stock at the lower strike share price when the market price is more.If the stock's market value falls below the option strike price, the writer is obligated to buy shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. In other words, the put option will be exercised by the option buyer who sells their shares at the strike price as it is higher than the stock's market value.The risk for the put option writer happens when the market's price falls below the strike price. The seller is forced to purchase shares at the strike price at expiration. The writer's loss can be significant depending on how much the shares depreciate.The writer (or seller) can either hold on to the shares and hope the stock price rises back above the purchase price or sell the shares and take the loss. Any loss is offset by the premium received.An investor may write put options at a strike price where they see the shares being a good value and would be willing to buy at that price. When the price falls and the buyer exercises their option, they get the stock at the price they want with the added benefit of receiving the option premium.ProsA call option buyer has the right to buy assets at a lower price than the market when the stock's price risesThe put option buyer profits by selling stock at the strike price when the market price is below the strike priceOption sellers receive a premium fee from the buyer for writing an optionConsThe put option seller may have to buy the asset at the higher strike price than they would normally pay if the market fallsThe call option writer faces infinite risk if the stock's price rises and are forced to buy shares at a high priceOption buyers must pay an upfront premium to the writers of the optionExample of an OptionSuppose that Microsoft (MFST) shares trade at $108 per share and you believe they will increase in value. You decide to buy a call option to benefit from an increase in the stock's price. You purchase one call option with a strike price of $115 for one month in the future for 37 cents per contract. Your total cash outlay is $37 for the position plus fees and commissions (0.37 x 100 = $37).If the stock rises to $116, your option will be worth $1, since you could exercise the option to acquire the stock for $115 per share and immediately resell it for $116 per share. The profit on the option position would be 170.3% since you paid 37 cents and earned $1—that's much higher than the 7.4% increase in the underlying stock price from $108 to $116 at the time of expiry.In other words, the profit in dollar terms would be a net of 63 cents or $63 since one option contract represents 100 shares [($1 - 0.37) x 100 = $63].If the stock fell to $100, your option would expire worthlessly, and you would be out $37 premium. The upside is that you didn't buy 100 shares at $108, which would have resulted in an $8 per share, or $800, total loss. As you can see, options can help limit your downside risk.Options Terminology to KnowOptions trading involves a lot of lingo, here are just some of the key terminology to know the meanings of:At-the-money (ATM)- an option whose strike price is exactly that of where the underlying is trading. ATM options have a delta of 0.50.In-the-money (ITM)- an option with intrinsic value, and a delta greater than 0.50. For a call, the strike price of an ITM option will be below the current price of the underlying; for a put, above the current price.Out-of-the-money (OTM)- an option with only extrinsic (time) value and a delta a less than 0.50. For a call, the strike price of an OTM option will be above the current price of the underlying; for a put, below the current price.Premium- the price paid for an option in the marketStrike price- the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying, also known as the exercise price.Underlying- the security upon which the option is basedImplied volatility (IV)- the volatility of the underlying (how quickly and severely it moves), as revealed by market pricesExercise- when an options contract owner exercises the right to buy or sell at the strike price. The seller is then said to beassigned.Expiration- the date at which the options contract expires, or ceases to exist. OTM options will expire worthless.How Do Options Work?Options are a type of derivative product that allow investors to speculate on or hedge against the volatility of an underlying stock. Options are divided into call options, which allow buyers to profit if the price of the stock increases, and put options, in which the buyer profits if the price of the stock declines. Investors can also go short an option by selling them to other investors. Shorting (or selling) a call option would therefore mean profiting if the underlying stock declines while selling a put option would mean profiting if the stock increases in value.What Are the Main Advantages of Options?Options can be very useful as a source of leverage and risk hedging. For example, a bullish investor who wishes to invest $1,000 in a company could potentially earn a far greater return by purchasing $1,000 worth of call options on that firm, as compared to buying $1,000 of that company’s shares.In this sense, the call options provide the investor with a way to leverage their position by increasing their buying power.On the other hand, if that same investor already has exposure to that same company and wants to reduce that exposure, they could hedge their risk by selling put options against that company.What Are the Main Disadvantages of Options?The main disadvantage of options contracts is that they are complex and difficult to price. This is why options are considered to be a security most suitable for experienced professional investors. In recent years, they have become increasingly popular among retail investors. Because of their capacity for outsized returns or losses, investors should make sure they fully understand the potential implications before entering into any options positions. Failing to do so can lead to devastating losses.How Do Options Differ From Futures?Bothoptions and futuresare types of derivatives contracts that are based on some underlying asset or security. The main difference is that options contracts grant the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying in the future.Futures contractshave this obligation.Is an Options Contract an Asset?Yes, an options contract is a derivatives security, which is a type of asset.The Bottom LineOptions are a type of derivative product that allow investors to speculate on or hedge against the volatility of an underlying stock. Options are divided into call options, which allow buyers to profit if the price of the stock increases, and put options, in which the buyer profits if the price of the stock declines. Investors can also go short an option by selling them to other investors. Shorting (or selling) a call option would therefore mean profiting if the underlying stock declines while selling a put option would mean profiting if the stock increases in value.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on afutures exchange.The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy and receive the underlying asset when the futures contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide and deliver the underlying asset at the expiration date.Key TakeawaysFutures contracts are financial derivatives that oblige the buyer to purchase some underlying asset (or the seller to sell that asset) at a predetermined future price and date.A futures contract allows an investor to speculate on the direction of a security, commodity, or financial instrument, either long or short, using leverage.Futures are also often used to hedge the price movement of the underlying asset to help prevent losses from unfavorable price changes.There are tradeable futures contracts for almost any commodity imaginable, such as grain, livestock, energy, currencies, and even securities.In the United States, futures contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Investopedia / Joules GarciaUnderstanding Futures ContractsFutures are derivative financial contracts that obligate the parties to transact an asset at a predetermined future date and price.Here, the buyer must purchase or the seller must sell theunderlying assetat the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date.Underlying assets include physical commodities or other financial instruments. Futures contracts detail the quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitatetrading on a futures exchange. Futures can be used for hedging or trade speculation.\"Futures contract\" and \"futures\" refer to the same thing. For example, you might hear somebody say they bought oil futures, which means the same thing as an oil futures contract. When someone says \"futures contract,\" they're typically referring to a specific type of future, such as oil, gold, bonds, or S&P 500 index futures. Futures contracts are also one of the most direct ways toinvest in oil. The term \"futures\" is more general, and is often used to refer to the whole market, such as, \"They're a futures trader.\"Futures contracts are standardized, unlike forward contracts.Forwardsare similar types of agreements that lock in a future price in the present, but forwards are tradedover-the-counter(OTC) and have customizable terms that are arrived at between the counterparties. Futures contracts, on the other hand, will each have the same terms regardless of who is the counterparty.Application of a Futures ContractsFutures contracts are used by two categories of market participants:hedgersand speculators.HedgersProducers or purchasers of an underlying assethedge or guarantee the priceat which the commodity is sold or purchased. They use futures contracts to ensure that they have a buyer and a satisfactory price, hedging against any changes in the market.An oil producer needs to sell its oil. They may use futures contracts to lock in a price they will sell at, and then deliver the oil to the buyerwhen the futures contract expires. Similarly, a manufacturing company may need oil for making widgets. Since they like to plan ahead and always have oil coming in each month, they too may use futures contracts. This way they know in advance the price they will pay for oil (the futures contract price) and they know they will be taking delivery of the oil once the contract expires.SpeculatorsSince many commodity prices tend to move in predictable patterns, it is possible to make a profit by trading futures, even if one does not have a direct interest in the underlying commodity. Traders and fund managers use futures to bet on the price of the underlying asset.For example, a trader may buy grain futures if they expect the price of grain to increase before the delivery date. Any unexpected changes to the weather or growing conditions may cause the futures price to rise or drop.Types of Futures ContractsFutures contracts can be used to set prices on any type of commodity or asset, so long as there is a sufficiently large market for it. Some of the most frequently traded types of futures are outlined below:Agricultural Futures:These were the original futures contracts available at markets like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition to grain futures, there are also tradable futures contracts in fibers (such as cotton), lumber, milk, coffee, sugar, and even livestock.Energy Futures:These provide exposure to the most common fuels and energy products, such as crude oil and natural gas.Metal Futures:These contracts trade in industrial metals, such as gold, steel, and copper.Currency Futures:These contracts provide exposure to changes in the exchange rates and interest rates of different national currencies.Financial Futures:Contracts that trade in the future value of a security or index. For example, there are futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes. There are also futures for debt products, such as U.S. Treasury bonds andGerman Bundesobligation (BOBL) bonds.Futures Contract vs. Forward ContractA futures contract is similar to aforwards contract, where a buyer and seller agree to set a price and quantity of a product for delivery at a later date. Both types of contract can be used for speculation, as well as hedging.However, there are also importantdifferences. While a futures contract is a standardized agreement that can be traded on an exchange, a forward contract is simply a private agreement between a buyer and a seller. While it is possible to trade forwards on OTC markets, they are less regulated and less accessible to retail investors. This means that there are also more opportunities to customize a forward agreement according to the buyer's and seller's needs.Mechanics of a Futures ContractImagine an oil producer plans to produce one million barrels of oil over the next year. It will be ready for delivery in 12 months. Assume the current price is $75 per barrel. The producer could produce the oil, and then sell it at the current market prices one year from today.Given the volatility of oil prices, the market price at that time could be very different than the current price. If the oil producer thinks oil will be higher in one year, they may opt not to lock in a price now. But, if they think $75 is a good price, they could lock in a guaranteed sale price by entering into a futures contract.A mathematical model is used to price futures, which takes into account the currentspot price, therisk-free rate of return, time to maturity, storage costs, dividends, dividend yields, andconvenience yields. Assume that the one-year oil futures contracts are priced at $78 per barrel. By entering into this contract, in one year the producer is obligated to deliver one million barrels of oil and is guaranteed to receive $78 million. The $78 price per barrel is received regardless of where spot market prices are at the time.Contracts arestandardized. For example, one oil contract on theChicago Mercantile Exchange(CME) is for 1,000 barrels of oil.Therefore, if someone wanted to lock in a price (selling or buying) on 100,000 barrels of oil, they would need to buy/sell 100 contracts. To lock in a price on one million barrels of oil/they would need to buy/sell 1,000 contracts.The futures markets are regulated by theCommodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market pricing, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraud, and regulating brokerage firms engaged in futures trading.Trading Futures ContractsRetail traders and portfolio managers are not interested in delivering or receiving the underlying asset. A retail trader has little need to receive 1,000 barrels of oil, but they may be interested in capturing a profit on the price moves of oil.Futurescontracts can be tradedpurely for profit, as long as the trade is closed before expiration. Many futures contracts expire on the third Friday of the month, but contracts do vary so check the contract specifications of any and all contracts before trading them.For example, it is January, and April contracts are trading at $55. If a trader believes that the price of oil will rise before the contract expires in April, they could buy the contract at $55. This gives them control of 1,000 barrels of oil. They are not required to pay $55,000 ($55 x 1,000 barrels) for this privilege, though. Rather, the broker only requires aninitial marginpayment, typically of a few thousand dollars for each contract.The profit or loss of the position fluctuates in the account as the price of the futures contract moves. If the loss gets too big, the broker will ask the trader to deposit more money to cover the loss. This is calledmaintenance margin.The final profit or loss of the trade is realized when the trade is closed. In this case, if the buyer sells the contract at $60, they make $5,000 [($60-$55) x 1,000). Alternatively, if the price drops to $50 and they close out the position there, they lose $5,000.How to Trade Futures ContractsWhy Is It Called a Futures Contract?A futures contract gets its name from the fact that the buyer and seller of the contract are agreeing to a price today for some asset or security that is to be delivered in the future.Are Futures and Forwards the Same Thing?These two types of derivatives contract function in much the same way, but the main difference is that futures are exchange-traded and have standardized contract specifications. These exchanges are highly regulated and provide transparent contract and pricing data. Forwards, in contrast, trade over the counter (OTC) with terms and contract specifications customized by the two parties involved.What Happens If a Futures Contract Is Held Until It Expires?Unless the contract position isclosed outprior to its expiration, the short is obligated to make delivery to the long, who is obligated to take it. Depending on the contract, the values exchanged can besettled in cash. Most often, the trader will simply pay or receive a cash settlement depending on whether the underlying asset increased or decreased during the investment holding period. In some cases, however, futures contracts will requirephysical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would be responsible for storing the goods and would need to cover costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance.Who Uses Futures Contracts?Speculators can use futures contracts to bet on the future price of some asset or security. Hedgers use futures to lock in a price today to reduce market uncertainty between now and the time that good is to be delivered or received.Arbitrageurstrade futures contracts in or across related markets, taking advantage of theoretical mispricings that may exist temporarily.How Can I Trade Futures?Depending on your broker and your account status with that broker, you may be eligible to trade futures. You will require a margin account and be approved to do so. Qualified traders in the U.S. will often have the ability to trade futures on different exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),ICE FuturesU.S. (Intercontinental Exchange), and the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE).The Bottom LineFutures contracts play an important role in the smooth operations of the commodities market. They allow buyers and sellers to lock in prices in advance and help farmers, miners, manufacturers, and other market participants to work without having to worry about daily changes in the market. The prices of futures areaffected by interest rate changesand dividend payments.Article SourcesInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

Most cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks using blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.Key TakeawaysA cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law.The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and decentralized systems that do not collapse at a single point of failure.The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities.Investopedia / Tara AnandUnderstanding CryptocurrencyCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each validator on a network.Every new block generated must be verified before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger.Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) are using blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.Types of CryptocurrencyMany cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example,Ethereum'sether was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, ether (ETH) inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism.The XRP Ledger Foundation's XRP is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies.Because there are so many cryptocurrencies on the market,it's important to understandthe types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decidewhether it is worth investing in—a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use.Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find with some of the names of tokens in that category:Utility: XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains.Transactional: Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these.Governance: These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap.Platform: These tokens support applications built to use a blockchain, such as Solana.Security tokens: Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire.If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've found a new category or something that needs to be investigated to be sure it's legitimate.How to Buy CryptocurrencyIf you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit acryptocurrency exchange. These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a digital wallet or use a third-party service likeCoinbaseto store your coins.If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your brokerage. For example, Robinhood allows users to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, although you cannot withdraw them from the platform for purchases. In addition, there are several crypto ETFs that provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring the investors to maintain their own wallets. For instance, as of May 2024, investors may choose to holdBitcoin futures ETFshares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares.Is Cryptocurrency Legal?Fiat currenciesderive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\"But cryptocurrencies are not issued by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for theirlegal status in different financial jurisdictionsthroughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure.In the U.S.The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, theFinancial Action Task Force (FATF)recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets—either as capital gains or ordinary income—depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it.In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors purchased on exchanges.Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry.As of June 2024,El Salvadoris the only country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender for monetary transactions.In the rest of the world,cryptocurrency regulation variesby jurisdiction.In AsiaJapan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about the customer and details relating to the wire transfer.China hasbanned cryptocurrency exchanges, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has aCentral Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).India was reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies.In EuropeCryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as \"financial instruments.\" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies.Is Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment?Cryptocurrencies have attracted areputation as unstable investmentsdue to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure,the technical complexityof using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users.In addition to themarket risksassociated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks:User risk: Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. By some estimates, about one-fifth of all bitcoins are now inaccessible due to lost passwords or incorrect sending addresses.Regulatory risks: The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop.Counterparty risks:Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing one's entire investment.Management risks: Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.Programming risks:Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment.Market Manipulation:Market manipulation remains a substantial problem in cryptocurrency, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges acting unethically.Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have seen a significant price leap, with the total market capitalization rising to about $2.4 trillion.Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies.Advantages and Disadvantages of CryptocurrencyCryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.AdvantagesRemoves single points of failureEasier to transfer funds between partiesRemoves third partiesCan be used to generate returnsRemittances are streamlinedDisadvantagesTransactions are pseudonymousPseudonymity allows for criminal usesHave become highly centralizedExpensive to participate in a network and earnOff-chain security issuesPrices are very volatileAdvantages ExplainedCryptocurrencies representa new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure—such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S.Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralizedtransfersare secured by the use ofpublic keysandprivate keysand different forms of incentive systems, such asproof of workorproof of stake.Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans indecentralized financeare an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading.Theremittanceeconomy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoinserve as intermediate currenciesto streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement.Disadvantages ExplainedThough theyclaim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions.Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case ofDread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known.Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in their funds.One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However,mining popular cryptocurrenciesrequires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues run into billions of dollars.Only 61 (1%) of the 4,568 Bitcoin blocks opened from May 15, 2024, to June 15, 2024, were opened by unknown addresses. The other 99% were opened by mining pools.Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins.Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investmentsrequire accurate price monitoring. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later.Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies aspeculative bubble.Is Crypto Actually a Good Investment?Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth.Is Crypto Real Money?One definition of money is something that is generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure or store of value, and a unit of account. By this definition, cryptocurrency is real money.How Does Crypto Make You Money?There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods are guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefitted from them.The Bottom LineCryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important tounderstand the risks involvedbefore investing.The comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
